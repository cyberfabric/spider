# Feature-Driven Design (FDD)

**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Active  
**Audience**: Development teams, technical leads, architects

Feature-Driven Design is a **universal methodology** for building software systems with clear traceability from requirements to implementation.

**Built for modern development**: FDD works with AI coding assistants, supports any tech stack, and provides structured workflows that teams can follow manually or automate.

---

## What is FDD?

FDD helps teams build software by:

1. **Designing before coding**: Document what you're building in clear, reviewable formats
2. **Breaking work into features**: Each feature is independent and testable
3. **Using plain English**: Algorithms described in FDL (not code), reviewable by non-programmers
4. **Tracking changes atomically**: Implementation changes ensure every change is traceable
5. **Validating designs**: Catch issues before implementation

## FDD Flow Overview

![FDD Layered Flow](fdd-flow-layers.drawio.svg)

**The 7-layer flow** (each layer builds on validated previous layer):

**Layer 0: Project Adapter** (Architect, Project Manager)
- Define tech stack & conventions (any language, any tools)
- Workflows: `adapter`, `adapter-agents`, `adapter-from-source`

**Layer 1: Business Context** (Product Owner, Project Manager)
- Define business requirements, use cases, capabilities
- Workflows: `business-context`, `business-validate`
- ✅ Validated before proceeding

**Layer 2: Overall Design** (Architect, Project Manager)
- Actors, domain model, API contracts, industry best practices
- Workflows: `design`, `design-validate`, `adr`, `adr-validate`
- ✅ Validated (≥90/100) before proceeding

**Layer 3: Feature Planning** (Architect, Project Manager)
- FEATURES.md manifest, feature list, dependencies, design decomposition
- Workflows: `features`, `features-validate`
- ✅ Validated before proceeding

**Layer 4: Feature Design** (Solution Architect, Project Manager)
- Actor flows in FDL, algorithms, states, requirements
- Validated against overall design
- Workflows: `feature`, `feature-validate`
- ✅ Validated (100/100) before proceeding

**Layer 5: Feature Changes** (Developer/QA, Project Manager)
- Atomic implementation changes with tasks
- Specs validated against feature design
- Workflows: `feature-changes`, `feature-changes-validate`
- ✅ Validated before proceeding

**Layer 6: Implementation** (Developer/QA, Project Manager)
- Code validated against spec automatically
- Workflows: `feature-change-implement`, `feature-change-validate`

**Key principles**: 
- Each layer validated before proceeding to next
- Design is source of truth, enforced by tooling
- Business Context → Design → Features → Implementation
- All workflows support CREATE & UPDATE modes for iteration

## The AGENTS.md Foundation

### Built on Industry Standard for AI Frameworks

FDD is built on the **AGENTS.md approach** - an emerging industry standard for structuring AI-native frameworks and methodologies. This isn't just a documentation pattern; it's **the starting point** for any AI-assisted development framework.

**What is AGENTS.md?**

A standardized file (`AGENTS.md`) that serves as the **single source of truth** for AI agents, containing:
- Complete methodology rules and constraints
- Workflow references and execution patterns
- Tool usage instructions
- Project-specific context and conventions

**Why AGENTS.md is the Superior Approach**:

| Traditional Approach | AGENTS.md Approach |
|---------------------|-------------------|
| ❌ Scattered docs across README, wikis, comments | ✅ Single entry point for AI agents |
| ❌ AI must search and piece together context | ✅ Complete context in one place |
| ❌ Inconsistent interpretation of rules | ✅ Unambiguous, machine-readable instructions |
| ❌ Manual workflow execution prone to errors | ✅ Workflows referenced and executable |
| ❌ No separation of human vs AI documentation | ✅ Optimized specifically for AI consumption |
| ❌ Changes require updating multiple locations | ✅ Update once, agents always have latest |

**Industry Adoption - The Emerging Standard**:

The AGENTS.md pattern is being adopted across major AI frameworks:

1. **FDD** (This Framework)
   - `spec/FDD/AGENTS.md` - core methodology
   - `spec/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md` - project-specific extensions
   - Two-level AGENTS.md hierarchy for universal + specific rules

3. **Cursor AI** (`.cursorrules`)
   - Early adopter of "rules file for AI" concept
   - Single-file format (precursor to AGENTS.md)
   - Proves demand for AI-specific instruction files

4. **Anthropic Claude** (MCP protocol)
   - Model Context Protocol servers expose resources
   - Pattern: structured context for AI agents
   - Aligns with AGENTS.md philosophy

5. **Windsurf/Cline/Aider**
   - All support agent-specific config files
   - Moving toward standardized formats
   - AGENTS.md provides that standardization

**Why This is the Best Approach for AI Frameworks**:

✅ **Instant Context Loading**
```
AI Agent starts → Reads AGENTS.md → Has complete methodology
```
No searching, no ambiguity, immediate understanding.

✅ **Workflow Automation**
```
AGENTS.md references: workflows/feature.md
AI Agent: Follows workflow step-by-step automatically
```
Workflows become executable, not just documentation.

✅ **Version Control for AI Instructions**
```
git log spec/FDD/AGENTS.md
→ See exactly when methodology rules changed
→ Trace why AI behaves differently across versions
```

✅ **Composable Context**
```
FDD/AGENTS.md (universal rules)
    ↓ extends
FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md (project-specific)
    ↓ extends
FDD-Adapter/workflows/AGENTS.md (workflow overrides)
```
Layered approach: core + extensions, never duplicated.

✅ **Human + AI Harmony**
- README.md → Human-readable overview
- AGENTS.md → Machine-optimized instructions
- Both reference same workflows, same structure
- No duplication, no drift

**FDD's AGENTS.md Architecture**:

```
spec/FDD/AGENTS.md                    # ← STARTING POINT
├─ Core Methodology Rules             (immutable, validated)
├─ Design Hierarchy                   (OVERALL → FEATURE → CHANGES → CODE)
├─ Workflow References                (18 workflows)
└─ Atomic Change Management           (implementation tracking)
    ↓ AI agent reads this FIRST
    
spec/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md            # ← PROJECT CONTEXT
├─ Domain Model Technology            (GTS, JSON Schema, etc.)
├─ API Contract Format                (OpenAPI, CLISPEC, etc.)
├─ Project Conventions                (naming, structure, security)
└─ Workflow Extensions                (project-specific steps)
    ↓ Extends core, never contradicts
    
spec/FDD-Adapter/workflows/AGENTS.md  # ← WORKFLOW OVERRIDES
└─ Custom workflow selection logic    (optional, project-specific)
```

**The Starting Point: Always AGENTS.md**

When an AI agent encounters a project using FDD:

```
Step 1: Agent reads spec/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md
        ↓
        "READ FIRST: spec/FDD/AGENTS.md"
        
Step 2: Agent reads spec/FDD/AGENTS.md
        ↓
        Core methodology loaded
        
Step 3: Agent reads project adapter (FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md)
        ↓
        Project-specific context loaded
        
Step 4: Agent is ready
        ↓
        Complete understanding: methodology + project + workflows
```

**No other file is needed before starting.** AGENTS.md is the root of everything.

**Proof This Works: Real-World Results**

FDD development using AGENTS.md approach:
- ✅ **fdd-cli** built entirely with AI agents following FDD/AGENTS.md
- ✅ Complete designs created in minutes (not hours)
- ✅ Zero ambiguity - agent never "guesses" what to do
- ✅ Consistent structure across all features
- ✅ Workflows executed correctly without human intervention

**The Future: AGENTS.md as Standard**

We believe AGENTS.md will become the universal pattern for:
- ✅ Development frameworks (FDD, etc.)
- ✅ Build tools (Maven, Gradle, npm with AI integration)
- ✅ Testing frameworks (Jest, Pytest with agent runners)
- ✅ CI/CD systems (GitHub Actions, GitLab CI with AI steps)

**Every project will have AGENTS.md** - just like every project has README.md today.

## Key Strengths

### 1. 🎯 Interactive Workflows - Your AI Pair Programmer

FDD provides **10 operation workflows** that guide you step-by-step through the entire development process. Each workflow **works in two modes**: CREATE (generate new) and UPDATE (edit existing), making them fully independent and iterative.

**Key Innovation: Create AND Edit Support**

All operation workflows automatically detect whether you're creating something new or updating existing artifacts:
- **CREATE mode**: Generates from scratch with guided questions
- **UPDATE mode**: Reads current content, proposes changes, preserves unchanged parts

**Example: Creating or Updating a Project Adapter**

First time:
```
Follow @spec/FDD/workflows/adapter.md
→ No adapter found → CREATE mode
```

Later, to update:
```
Follow @spec/FDD/workflows/adapter.md
→ Adapter exists → UPDATE mode
→ What to update?
   - Domain model specs
   - API contract specs
   - Testing configuration
   - Build commands
```

Both modes ask targeted questions:
```
Q1: Project name?
   CREATE: Propose from package.json
   UPDATE: Show current "fdd-cli", ask to change or keep

Q2: Domain model technology?
   CREATE: Detect and propose (GTS, JSON Schema, TypeScript...)
   UPDATE: Show current "GTS", ask to change or keep

Q3: API contract format?
   CREATE: Propose (OpenAPI, CLISPEC, GraphQL...)
   UPDATE: Show current "CLISPEC", ask to change or keep
```

**Result**: 
- **CREATE**: Fully configured adapter in 5-10 minutes
- **UPDATE**: Targeted changes without recreating everything

**Example: Iterating on Feature Design**

```
Follow @spec/FDD/workflows/feature.md
→ Feature exists → UPDATE mode
→ What to update?
   - Add new actor flow
   - Edit existing algorithm
   - Update technical details
   - Add new requirements
```

Workflow shows current content and asks for specific changes - no need to start from scratch.

**Why This Is Revolutionary**:
- ✅ **Truly iterative** - Update artifacts as project evolves
- ✅ **No data loss** - UPDATE mode preserves unchanged content
- ✅ **Independent workflows** - Run any workflow anytime
- ✅ **No memorization** - Workflows guide you every time
- ✅ **No mistakes** - Each step validated before proceeding
- ✅ **Consistent results** - Same structure every time
- ✅ **AI-friendly** - AI agents follow workflows naturally
- ✅ **Human-readable** - Anyone can execute manually if needed

### 2. 🔧 Adapter System - Works With Any Tech Stack

FDD core is **100% technology-agnostic**. Your project adapter makes it specific to YOUR stack.

**Adapters define**:
- **Domain model format**: GTS, JSON Schema, TypeScript, Protobuf, CTI, etc.
- **API contracts**: OpenAPI, GraphQL, gRPC, RAML, CLISPEC, etc.
- **Testing strategy**: Jest, Pytest, Go test, etc.
- **Build tools**: Webpack, Vite, Cargo, Maven, etc.
- **Project conventions**: Naming, structure, security model

**Example Adapters**:

**Microservice with REST API**:
```yaml
Domain Model: OpenAPI + JSON Schema
API Contracts: OpenAPI 3.1
Testing: Jest + Supertest
Deployment: Docker + Kubernetes
```

**CLI Tool**:
```yaml
Domain Model: GTS (Global Type System)
API Contracts: CLISPEC (command specifications)
Testing: Vitest
Deployment: npm publish
```

**GraphQL Backend**:
```yaml
Domain Model: GraphQL Schema
API Contracts: GraphQL SDL
Testing: Apollo Server Testing
Deployment: Serverless
```

**Why This Matters**:
- ✅ **Use your existing stack** - No forced technology choices
- ✅ **Migrate gradually** - Add FDD to existing projects
- ✅ **Team flexibility** - Different teams, different stacks, same methodology
- ✅ **Future-proof** - New tech? Just create new adapter

### 3. 📋 Workflow-Driven Development - Everything Has a Process

In FDD, **every action is a workflow**. Development becomes predictable and repeatable.

**Workflow Categories**:

**Operation Workflows** (10 workflows - all support CREATE & UPDATE modes):
```
Adapter Configuration:
├─ adapter.md               → Create OR update project adapter
├─ adapter-from-sources.md  → Create OR update adapter from codebase analysis
└─ adapter-agents.md        → Create OR update AI agent integration

Architecture & Requirements:
├─ business-context.md      → Create OR update business context (BUSINESS.md)
├─ adr.md                   → Create/add/edit Architecture Decision Records
└─ design.md                → Create OR update overall design (DESIGN.md)

Feature Management:
├─ features.md              → Create OR update features manifest (FEATURES.md)
├─ feature.md               → Create OR update feature design
├─ feature-changes.md       → Create OR update feature implementation plan
└─ feature-change-implement.md → Implement changes (works with existing CHANGES.md)
```

**Validation Workflows** (automated, read-only):
```
├─ business-validate.md     → Validate BUSINESS.md structure
├─ adr-validate.md          → Validate ADR.md structure  
├─ design-validate.md       → Validate DESIGN.md (≥90/100)
├─ features-validate.md     → Validate FEATURES.md manifest
├─ feature-validate.md      → Validate feature DESIGN.md (100/100)
├─ feature-changes-validate.md → Validate CHANGES.md structure
├─ feature-change-validate.md  → Validate specific change
└─ feature-qa.md            → Complete feature QA report
```

**Key Principle**: All operation workflows are **independent and iterative** - run them anytime to create new or update existing artifacts.

**Real Development Flow**:
```
Day 1: Create adapter
       Run: adapter.md workflow
       → CREATE mode detected (no adapter exists)
       → 10 minutes, adapter ready

Day 2: Create business context & design
       Run: business-context.md workflow
       → CREATE mode, 30 min, BUSINESS.md complete
       
       Run: design.md workflow  
       → CREATE mode, 2-3 hours, DESIGN.md complete
       → Auto-creates ADR-0001 (Initial Architecture)
       
       Run: design-validate.md
       → 5 minutes, score 95/100 ✅
       → Auto-validates ADR.md

Day 3: Plan features
       Run: features.md workflow
       → CREATE mode, 5 minutes, FEATURES.md generated
       
       Run: features-validate.md
       → 5 minutes, manifest validated ✅

Week 1-2: Develop features (iterative)
          Run: feature.md workflow
          → CREATE: New feature design, 1-2 hours
          → UPDATE: Edit flows/algorithms, 15-30 min
          
          Run: feature-validate.md
          → 100/100 score required ✅
          
          Run: feature-changes.md workflow
          → CREATE: Implementation plan
          → UPDATE: Add/edit changes as needed
          
          Run: feature-change-implement.md
          → Code implementation

Ongoing: Update artifacts as project evolves
         → Update adapter: adapter.md (UPDATE mode)
         → Update design: design.md (UPDATE mode)
         → Add ADRs: adr.md (ADD mode)
         → Update features: feature.md (UPDATE mode)
```

**Why Workflows Matter**:
- ✅ **Nothing forgotten** - Checklists ensure completeness
- ✅ **Clear handoffs** - Team knows exactly what to do next
- ✅ **Progress tracking** - Always know where you are
- ✅ **Onboarding speed** - New members follow workflows
- ✅ **Quality gates** - Validation before proceeding

### 4. � FDD vs OpenSpec - Design-First vs Change-First

**Honest comparison**: Both are valuable methodologies, but they solve different problems.

| Aspect | OpenSpec | FDD |
|--------|----------|-----|
| **Primary Focus** | Change management | Design-first development |
| **What it defines** | ✅ How to track changes<br>✅ Delta specifications<br>✅ Change history | ✅ What to build (architecture)<br>✅ How it works (actor flows)<br>✅ Why decisions were made |
| **Starting point** | ❌ Assumes you know what to build<br>Start with change proposal | ✅ Start with business context<br>Define overall design first |
| **Design artifacts** | ❌ No overall design structure<br>❌ No business context document<br>❌ No feature planning | ✅ BUSINESS.md (business context)<br>✅ DESIGN.md (architecture)<br>✅ ADR.md (decision records)<br>✅ FEATURES.md (feature manifest) |
| **Actor flows** | ❌ Not part of methodology<br>Write in change proposals | ✅ Section B of every feature<br>✅ Reviewable by non-programmers<br>✅ Uses FDL (plain English) |
| **Domain model** | ❌ No standardized location<br>Define per change | ✅ Defined once in Overall Design<br>✅ Referenced by all features<br>✅ Technology-agnostic (GTS, JSON Schema, etc.) |
| **API contracts** | ❌ No standardized location<br>Define per change | ✅ Defined once in Overall Design<br>✅ Referenced by all features<br>✅ Format-agnostic (OpenAPI, GraphQL, etc.) |
| **Cross-feature validation** | ❌ No mechanism<br>Manual coordination needed | ✅ Built-in validation<br>✅ Detects type redefinitions<br>✅ Validates dependencies |
| **Stakeholder review** | ⚠️ Technical proposals<br>Requires technical knowledge | ✅ Plain English actor flows<br>✅ Business-reviewable designs<br>✅ FDL algorithms |
| **Change tracking** | ✅ Excellent atomic tracking<br>✅ Clear change history<br>✅ Delta specifications | ✅ CHANGES.md per feature<br>✅ Task checklists<br>✅ Status tracking |
| **Implementation** | ✅ One change at a time<br>✅ Clear tasks per change | ✅ CHANGES.md guides implementation<br>✅ Validated against feature design |
| **AI integration** | ⚠️ AI can implement changes<br>But must know what to build | ✅ AI follows complete methodology<br>✅ AGENTS.md provides full context<br>✅ Workflows guide every step |
| **Learning curve** | ✅ Simple to start<br>Just create changes | ⚠️ Requires understanding methodology<br>But workflows guide you |
| **Best for** | ✅ Tracking implementation changes<br>✅ Delta documentation<br>✅ Audit trails | ✅ Design-first projects<br>✅ Team collaboration<br>✅ Stakeholder involvement<br>✅ Complex systems |

**When to use what**:

**Use OpenSpec alone** if you:
- Have clear requirements already documented elsewhere
- Small team, everyone knows what to build
- Need only change tracking and audit trail
- Don't need cross-feature coordination

**Use FDD** if you:
- Need to design before implementation
- Want stakeholders to review logic
- Have multiple features with dependencies
- Need overall architecture documentation
- Want AI to follow complete methodology
- Need validation before coding

**Use FDD + OpenSpec** if you:
- Want best of both worlds (FDD has built-in CHANGES.md tracking)
- FDD's CHANGES.md may be sufficient for many projects
- OpenSpec adds more powerful delta tracking if needed

**Key insight**: FDD includes change tracking via CHANGES.md. You get design artifacts + change tracking in one methodology. OpenSpec is optional if you need more sophisticated change management.

### 5. �📝 FDL (FDD Description Language) - Logic Without Code

FDD uses **FDL** - plain English pseudocode for describing algorithms, actor flows, and state machines. This is one of FDD's most powerful innovations.

**What is FDL?**

Plain English syntax for describing logic that **anyone can read**, not just programmers:

```
1. User clicks "Add to Cart" button
2. System checks if item is in stock
   2.1. IF out of stock
       2.1.1. Show error "Item unavailable"
       2.1.2. STOP
3. System adds item to cart
4. System updates cart count
5. Show success message "Item added"
```

**Why FDL is a Game-Changer**:

✅ **Stakeholders Can Review Logic**
- Business analysts review actor flows
- Product managers validate user experiences
- QA designs test scenarios from flows
- No programming knowledge needed

✅ **Language-Agnostic Design**
- Same design works for Python, JavaScript, Go, any language
- Refactor implementation without changing design
- Multiple teams can implement same design differently

✅ **AI-Friendly**
- AI agents convert FDL → code automatically
- No ambiguity in instructions
- Clear step-by-step logic

✅ **Focus on Logic, Not Syntax**
- Designers think about "what happens" not "how to code it"
- No distractions from language-specific details
- Catch logical errors before coding

**Real Example: Authentication Flow**

**FDL in DESIGN.md**:
```
### Flow: User Login

1. User submits login form
2. System validates email format
   2.1. IF invalid format
       2.1.1. Show error "Invalid email address"
       2.1.2. STOP
3. System checks credentials in database
4. IF credentials match
   4.1. Generate session token
   4.2. Store token in cookies
   4.3. Redirect to dashboard
5. ELSE
   5.1. Increment failed login counter
   5.2. IF failed attempts >= 3
       5.2.1. Lock account for 15 minutes
       5.2.2. Send security email
   5.3. Show error "Invalid credentials"
```

**Review Process**:
- Product Manager reads → "Yes, this matches requirements"
- Security Team reads → "Add rate limiting at step 5.2"
- QA reads → "I'll test all branches: valid, invalid format, wrong password, account lock"
- Developer reads → "Clear implementation path"

**Then AI converts to code** - but the logic was reviewed and approved first.

**FDL vs Code in Design Docs**:

| Code in DESIGN.md | FDL in DESIGN.md |
|-------------------|------------------|
| ❌ Only programmers can review | ✅ Anyone can review |
| ❌ Couples design to language | ✅ Language-agnostic |
| ❌ Syntax distracts from logic | ✅ Pure logic focus |
| ❌ Outdates when refactored | ✅ Stable across refactors |
| ❌ AI may misinterpret | ✅ Clear AI instructions |

**Where FDL is Used**:

1. **Actor Flows** (Section B) - PRIMARY
   - What each actor does step-by-step
   - All interactions and user journeys

2. **Algorithms** (Section C)
   - Business logic processing
   - Data transformations
   - Calculations and validations

3. **State Machines** (Section D, optional)
   - State transitions
   - Conditions for state changes
   - Actions on state entry/exit

**FDL Syntax Guide**:

```
Basic structure:
1. Action or event
2. Another action
   2.1. Nested detail
   2.2. Another detail
3. Conditional
   3.1. IF condition
       3.1.1. Action if true
   3.2. ELSE
       3.2.1. Action if false
4. Loops
   4.1. FOR EACH item in list
       4.1.1. Process item
5. STOP - terminates flow

Keywords (ALL CAPS):
- IF / ELSE - conditions
- FOR EACH - loops
- STOP - terminate
- AND / OR - logical operators
- WHILE - conditional loops
```

**Why No Code in Designs**:

FDD **strictly prohibits code** in DESIGN.md files:
- ❌ No `if (x > 5) { ... }` syntax
- ❌ No function definitions
- ❌ No framework-specific patterns
- ✅ Only FDL plain English

**This is enforced by validation** - designs with code fail validation.

**The Business Impact**:

Before FDL:
```
Developer writes algorithm in code
    ↓
Stakeholder can't review (too technical)
    ↓
Logic bug discovered in production
    ↓
Expensive fix + customer impact
```

With FDL:
```
Designer writes algorithm in FDL
    ↓
Stakeholder reviews and approves
    ↓
Developer implements validated logic
    ↓
Bug caught before coding
```

**See Full FDL Specification**: `spec/FDD/FDL.md`

### 6. 🏗️ Structured Project Organization - Rules and Validation

FDD enforces **consistent structure and validation** across your entire project.

**Project Structure Rules**:

```
architecture/
├── BUSINESS.md                  # Business context (required)
│   ├── Section A: Vision & Purpose
│   ├── Section B: Actors
│   ├── Section C: Capabilities
│   └── Section D: Additional Context
│
├── DESIGN.md                    # Overall Design (required)
│   ├── Section A: Architecture Overview
│   ├── Section B: Requirements & Principles
│   ├── Section C: Technical Architecture
│   └── Section D: Additional Context (optional)
│
├── ADR.md                       # Architecture Decision Records (MADR format)
│
├── diagrams/                    # Architecture diagrams
│
└── features/                    # All features
    ├── FEATURES.md             # Feature manifest (generated)
    │
    └── feature-{slug}/         # Individual feature
        ├── DESIGN.md           # Feature design (required)
        │   ├── Section A: Overview
        │   ├── Section B: Actor Flows (PRIMARY)
        │   ├── Section C: Algorithms
        │   ├── Section D: States (optional)
        │   ├── Section E: Technical Details
        │   ├── Section F: Requirements
        │   └── Section G: Implementation Plan
        │
        └── CHANGES.md          # Implementation changes
```

**Validation Rules Enforced**:

**Business Context Validation** (workflow business-validate):
- ✅ All sections present (A, B, C, D)
- ✅ Vision and purpose clearly defined
- ✅ All actors identified
- ✅ Core capabilities documented

**Overall Design Validation** (workflow design-validate):
- ✅ All sections present (A, B, C)
- ✅ Architecture style documented
- ✅ Domain model documented (in chosen DML format)
- ✅ API contracts documented (in chosen format)
- ✅ No contradictions in architecture
- ✅ Score ≥90/100 before proceeding

**Feature Design Validation** (workflow feature-validate):
- ✅ All sections present (A-G)
- ✅ Section B (Actor Flows) is PRIMARY and complete
- ✅ Algorithms in FDL only (no code)
- ✅ No type redefinitions (must reference Overall Design)
- ✅ All dependencies declared
- ✅ Implementation changes planned
- ✅ Score 100/100 + 100% completeness

**Documentation Rules**:
- ✅ **FDL only in designs** - No code in DESIGN.md files
- ✅ **Single source of truth** - Types defined once in Overall Design
- ✅ **Cross-references validated** - All references must exist
- ✅ **Status tracking** - Feature status always accurate
- ✅ **Dependency checking** - No circular dependencies allowed

**Why Structure and Validation Matter**:
- ✅ **Consistency** - Every feature follows same pattern
- ✅ **Quality gates** - Can't proceed with incomplete designs
- ✅ **Team coordination** - Everyone knows where to find things
- ✅ **Maintenance ease** - Structure is predictable
- ✅ **AI-friendly** - Clear structure helps AI navigate and generate

**Example Validation Failure**:
```
❌ Feature Design Validation Failed

Issues Found:
1. Section B (Actor Flows) incomplete - missing "User Logout" flow
2. Section E redefines type "User" - must reference Overall Design
3. Section G missing implementation change for "session management"

Score: 78/100 (minimum: 100/100)
Completeness: 85% (minimum: 100%)

→ Fix issues and re-run validation (workflow feature-validate)
```

## Why Use FDD?

### What You Get With FDD

**For Single Expert / Architect**:
- 🤖 **AI does 80% of the work**: Design → validation → implementation automated
- 📋 **Living documentation**: Designs stay up-to-date with code (enforced by validation)
- 🔍 **Full traceability**: From business requirement → design → code change
- ⚡ **Faster delivery**: AI handles boilerplate, you focus on business logic
- 🎯 **Catch issues early**: Validation happens before coding

**For Teams**:
- 👥 **Stakeholders can review**: Actor flows in plain English, no code knowledge needed
- 🔄 **Clear handoffs**: Feature designs are complete specs, not ambiguous tickets
- 📊 **Progress tracking**: FEATURES.md shows exactly what's done/in-progress/pending
- 🛡️ **Consistency**: Workflows enforce same standards across all features
- 📚 **Onboarding**: New team members read designs, not reverse-engineer code

**For Business**:
- 💰 **Lower costs**: Less rework, fewer bugs, faster development
- 📈 **Predictability**: Features have complete designs before implementation
- 🔒 **Risk reduction**: Validation catches architectural issues early
- 📖 **Audit trail**: Every change is documented and traceable

### What Happens Without FDD

**The typical scenario**:
1. 📝 Developer starts coding from vague requirements
2. 🤔 Discovers edge cases during implementation
3. 🔄 Goes back to architect/PM for clarification
4. ⏰ Delays accumulate, scope creeps
5. 🐛 Bugs discovered after deployment (logic wasn't reviewed)
6. 📉 Technical debt grows (no overall design document)
7. 🔥 Refactoring becomes risky (no source of truth)

**Specific problems FDD prevents**:

| Without FDD | With FDD |
|-------------|----------|
| ❌ Requirements in scattered Jira tickets | ✅ Complete Overall Design in one place |
| ❌ Stakeholders can't review logic | ✅ Actor flows reviewable by non-programmers |
| ❌ Type definitions duplicated across features | ✅ Domain model in Overall Design, referenced everywhere |
| ❌ API changes break other features | ✅ API contracts defined upfront, validated |
| ❌ "Documentation" outdated or missing | ✅ Designs validated against code, stay current |
| ❌ Developer interprets requirements differently | ✅ Feature Design is unambiguous spec |
| ❌ AI assistant generates inconsistent code | ✅ AI follows workflows, enforces patterns |
| ❌ Can't track feature dependencies | ✅ FEATURES.md shows dependency graph |
| ❌ Rework after stakeholder review | ✅ Stakeholders review design before coding |

---

### When NOT to Use FDD

FDD adds structure and validation. Skip it if:
- ❌ Prototype/throwaway code (no need for design docs)
- ❌ Trivial changes (single-line fixes)
- ❌ Well-understood patterns (no architectural decisions)

**Use FDD when**:
- ✅ Building production systems
- ✅ Working with AI assistants
- ✅ Need stakeholder review
- ✅ Multiple features with dependencies
- ✅ Long-term maintenance expected

---

## Core Components

### 1. Three-Level Design Hierarchy

**Business Context** (`architecture/BUSINESS.md`):
- System vision and purpose
- Key actors (users, systems, services)
- Core capabilities (what system can do)
- Business constraints and compliance requirements

**Overall Design** (`architecture/DESIGN.md`):
- Architecture style and layers
- Requirements and principles
- Domain model types (formally specified)
- API contracts (formally specified)
- Security model and NFRs
- Architecture Decision Records (ADR.md)

**Feature Design** (`architecture/features/feature-{slug}/DESIGN.md`):
- Feature overview and scope
- Actor flows (how users interact - PRIMARY)
- Algorithms in FDL (plain English logic)
- States (optional state machines)
- Technical details (database, operations, errors)
- Requirements (formalized scope + testing)
- Implementation plan (CHANGES.md)

### 2. Implementation Changes (Change Management)

Break features into atomic, traceable changes in CHANGES.md:

```
feature-login/
└── CHANGES.md          # Implementation changes with tasks
    ├── Change 001: Authentication
    │   ├── Purpose
    │   ├── Tasks checklist
    │   └── Status
    └── Change 002: Authorization
        ├── Purpose
        ├── Tasks checklist
        └── Status
```

### 3. Formal Specifications

**DML (Domain Model Language)** - you choose format:
- [GTS](https://github.com/GlobalTypeSystem/gts-spec), [CTI](https://github.com/acronis/go-cti/blob/main/cti-spec/SPEC.md), JSON Schema, RAML, Protobuf etc.
- Must be documented before implementation
- Should be machine-readable and versionable (recommended)

**API Contracts** - you choose format:
- OpenAPI, GraphQL Schema, gRPC, RAML, etc.
- **CLISPEC** (built-in format for CLI tools)
- Must be documented before implementation

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Quick Overview (5 minutes)

**Read these files**:
1. `README.md` (this file) - Overview
2. `QUICKSTART.md` - 5-minute quick start guide with examples
3. `FDL.md` - Learn plain English algorithm syntax
4. `workflows/README.md` - Understand workflow system

### 2. Add FDD to Your Project (15 minutes)

**Option A: Copy FDD core**
```bash
# In your project root
mkdir -p guidelines
cp -r /path/to/FDD guidelines/FDD
```

**Option B: Git submodule** (recommended for shared projects)
```bash
git submodule add <fdd-repo-url> guidelines/FDD
```

### 3. Create Project Adapter (5-10 minutes) 🤖

**Follow workflow**: `workflows/adapter.md`

With AI agent:
```
Follow @guidelines/FDD/workflows/adapter.md to create FDD adapter
```

This interactive workflow will:
1. Detect mode (CREATE/UPDATE)
2. Ask guided questions about your project
3. Choose domain model format (GTS, JSON Schema, TypeScript, etc.)
4. Choose API contract format (OpenAPI, GraphQL, CLISPEC, etc.)
5. Capture security model and non-functional requirements
6. Generate or update `spec/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md` and spec files

**Result**: Adapter created/updated at `spec/FDD-Adapter/` with status COMPLETE or INCOMPLETE

For manual setup, see: **`ADAPTER_GUIDE.md`**

### 4. Configure AI Agent (2 minutes, optional) 🤖

**Follow workflow**: `workflows/adapter-agents.md`

This optional workflow sets up your AI agent (Windsurf, Cursor, Cline, Aider) to use FDD natively:
- Detects existing config (UPDATE mode) or creates new (CREATE mode)
- Creates agent-specific configuration files
- Windsurf: `.windsurf/rules/` + workflow wrappers
- Cursor: `.cursorrules` (single file)
- Cline: `.clinerules` (single file)
- Aider: `.aider.conf.yml` (YAML config)

All configs:
- ✅ Tell agent to read FDD adapter first
- ✅ Provide FDD workflow references
- ✅ Follow agent-specific format

**Result**: Agent reads `spec/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md` automatically

### 5. Create Business Context & Design (2-4 hours) 🤖

**AI agent workflows**: 
```
Follow @guidelines/FDD/workflows/business-context.md
Follow @guidelines/FDD/workflows/design.md
```

These workflows guide you through creating BUSINESS.md and DESIGN.md with interactive questions.

### 6. Start First Feature (1-2 hours) 🤖

**AI agent workflows**:
```
Follow @guidelines/FDD/workflows/features.md  # Generate FEATURES.md
Follow @guidelines/FDD/workflows/feature.md   # Create feature design
```

These workflows extract features from design and guide you through creating feature designs.

---

## IDE Setup

To set up your AI assistant (Windsurf, Cursor, Cline, etc.) to work natively with FDD:

**Use workflow**: `workflows/adapter-agents.md`

This workflow creates agent-specific files (`.windsurf/rules/`, workflow wrappers) so your agent reads the FDD adapter and uses FDD workflows naturally.

---

## Working with AI Assistants

FDD is designed to work with AI coding assistants (but doesn't require them).

### AI Limitations

AI assistants can:
- ✅ Initialize structures
- ✅ Generate design templates
- ✅ Validate against checklists
- ✅ Implement changes from CHANGES.md
- ✅ Write tests

Humans must:
- ❌ Define business requirements
- ❌ Make architectural decisions
- ❌ Review actor flows
- ❌ Approve designs
- ❌ Final code review

---

## Team Workflow

**Default**: FDD is designed for a **single expert** (typically an architect) who handles all design and implementation work. The roles below describe abstract responsibilities that can be delegated if desired.

### Roles (can be combined or delegated)

**Technical Lead / Architect** (core role):
- Creates Overall Design
- Reviews all Feature Designs
- Creates project adapter
- Defines validation rules

**Feature Owner** (optional delegation):
- Creates Feature Design
- Creates implementation plan (CHANGES.md)
- Reviews implementation
- Marks feature complete

**Developer** (optional delegation):
- Implements changes from CHANGES.md
- Writes tests
- Updates feature status

**Stakeholder / QA** (optional review):
- Reviews actor flows (plain English)
- Reviews algorithms in FDL (reviewable)
- Validates business logic

### Process

```
1. Architect creates Overall Design
   ↓ (validated by team)
   
2. Team reviews Overall Design
   ↓ (approved)
   
3. Generate features from Overall Design
   ↓ (FEATURES.md created)
   
4. For each feature:
   4.1. Feature Owner creates DESIGN.md
   4.2. Team reviews actor flows
   4.3. Validate feature design
   4.4. Create implementation plan (CHANGES.md)
   4.5. Developers implement changes
   4.6. Mark feature complete
```

### Design Reviews

**Overall Design Review**:
- All team members review
- Stakeholders review vision and actors
- Technical team validates architecture
- Must score ≥90/100 before proceeding

**Feature Design Review**:
- Feature Owner presents
- Team reviews actor flows (Section B is PRIMARY)
- Algorithms in FDL reviewed by stakeholders
- Technical details reviewed by developers
- Must score 100/100 before implementation

### Implementation

**Change Implementation**:
- Developers pick changes from CHANGES.md
- Implement according to task checklist
- Update status when tests pass

**Feature Completion**:
- All changes implemented
- All tests pass
- Code compiles
- Feature marked ✅ in FEATURES.md

## FAQs

### Do I need AI assistants to use FDD?

**Recommended.** FDD is specifically designed to work with AI assistants that support agentic workflows. While workflows are human-readable, manual execution can be challenging and time-consuming.

**Without AI assistants**:
- You'll need a full team (architect + developers + QA)
- Workflows must be followed manually
- More overhead for validation and tracking

**With AI assistants** (recommended):
- Single expert (architect) can handle entire workflow
- AI follows workflows automatically
- Faster design generation and validation
- AI implements changes from CHANGES.md

### What tech stack do I need?

**Any.** FDD is technology-agnostic. You choose:
- Domain model format (GTS, CTI, JSON Schema, TypeScript, Protobuf, etc.)
- API format (OpenAPI, RAML, GraphQL, gRPC, etc.)
- Implementation language (JavaScript, Python, Go, etc.)

Your **adapter** documents these choices.

### How long does it take to set up?

- **Add FDD core**: 5 minutes
- **Create adapter**: 1-2 hours (first time)
- **Initialize project**: 30 minutes
- **First feature design**: 1-2 hours

After initial setup, feature design time depends on complexity.

### Can I use FDD with existing projects?

**Yes.** You can:
1. Add FDD to existing project
2. Create adapter for existing tech stack
3. Start documenting new features in FDD
4. Gradually migrate existing features (optional)


### What if my team doesn't know FDD?

Follow the onboarding checklist:
1. **Reading** (30 min): README.md, FDL.md, workflows/README.md
2. **Setup** (15 min): IDE, tools, adapter review
3. **Practice** (2 hours): Review example feature, create small feature with guidance

### How do I validate designs?

Follow validation workflows:
- **Business Context**: `workflows/business-validate.md`
- **Overall Design**: `workflows/design-validate.md`
- **Feature Design**: `workflows/feature-validate.md`

Validation is done via checklists (manual review). AI assistants can help automate checks.

## FDD CLI Tool

**Status**: 🚀 **Active Development**

The `fdd-cli` tool automates FDD workflows - structure initialization, design validation, feature management, and consistency checks.

**Repository**: [https://github.com/ainetx/fdd-cli](https://github.com/ainetx/fdd-cli)

**Why This Tool**:
- Automate FDD workflow execution (init, validate, generate)
- Enforce consistency across designs
- Manage implementation changes (CHANGES.md)
- Provide instant feedback on design quality

**Example Usage** *(in development)*:
```bash
fdd init                    # Initialize FDD structure
fdd validate architecture   # Validate Overall Design
fdd feature init <slug>     # Initialize new feature
fdd validate feature <slug> # Validate feature design
```

**Built with FDD**: The `fdd-cli` project itself is developed using FDD methodology - a real-world example of FDD in action. See the repository for complete designs, workflows, and implementation approach.
