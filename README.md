# Feature-Driven Design (FDD)

**Version**: 1.0  
**Status**: Active  
**Audience**: Development teams, technical leads, architects

Feature-Driven Design is a **universal methodology** for building software systems with clear traceability from requirements to implementation.

**Built for modern development**: FDD works with AI coding assistants, supports any tech stack, and provides structured workflows that teams can follow manually or automate.

---

## What is FDD?

FDD helps teams build software by:

1. **Designing before coding**: Document what you're building in clear, reviewable formats
2. **Breaking work into features**: Each feature is independent and testable
3. **Using plain English**: Algorithms described in FDL (not code), reviewable by non-programmers
4. **Tracking changes atomically**: OpenSpec ensures every change is traceable
5. **Validating designs**: Catch issues before implementation

---

## Why Use FDD?

### What You Get With FDD

**For Single Expert / Architect**:
- 🤖 **AI does 80% of the work**: Design → validation → implementation automated
- 📋 **Living documentation**: Designs stay up-to-date with code (enforced by validation)
- 🔍 **Full traceability**: From business requirement → design → code change
- ⚡ **Faster delivery**: AI handles boilerplate, you focus on business logic
- 🎯 **Catch issues early**: Validation happens before coding

**For Teams**:
- 👥 **Stakeholders can review**: Actor flows in plain English, no code knowledge needed
- 🔄 **Clear handoffs**: Feature designs are complete specs, not ambiguous tickets
- 📊 **Progress tracking**: FEATURES.md shows exactly what's done/in-progress/pending
- 🛡️ **Consistency**: Workflows enforce same standards across all features
- 📚 **Onboarding**: New team members read designs, not reverse-engineer code

**For Business**:
- 💰 **Lower costs**: Less rework, fewer bugs, faster development
- 📈 **Predictability**: Features have complete designs before implementation
- 🔒 **Risk reduction**: Validation catches architectural issues early
- 📖 **Audit trail**: Every change is documented and traceable

### What Happens Without FDD

**The typical scenario**:
1. 📝 Developer starts coding from vague requirements
2. 🤔 Discovers edge cases during implementation
3. 🔄 Goes back to architect/PM for clarification
4. ⏰ Delays accumulate, scope creeps
5. 🐛 Bugs discovered after deployment (logic wasn't reviewed)
6. 📉 Technical debt grows (no overall design document)
7. 🔥 Refactoring becomes risky (no source of truth)

**Specific problems FDD prevents**:

| Without FDD | With FDD |
|-------------|----------|
| ❌ Requirements in scattered Jira tickets | ✅ Complete Overall Design in one place |
| ❌ Stakeholders can't review logic | ✅ Actor flows reviewable by non-programmers |
| ❌ Type definitions duplicated across features | ✅ Domain model in Overall Design, referenced everywhere |
| ❌ API changes break other features | ✅ API contracts defined upfront, validated |
| ❌ "Documentation" outdated or missing | ✅ Designs validated against code, stay current |
| ❌ Developer interprets requirements differently | ✅ Feature Design is unambiguous spec |
| ❌ AI assistant generates inconsistent code | ✅ AI follows workflows, enforces patterns |
| ❌ Can't track feature dependencies | ✅ FEATURES.md shows dependency graph |
| ❌ Rework after stakeholder review | ✅ Stakeholders review design before coding |

### Why OpenSpec Alone Is Not Enough

**OpenSpec is excellent for change management**, but it solves only part of the problem:

**What OpenSpec Does Well** ✅:
- Tracks atomic changes
- Manages delta specifications
- Archives implementation history
- Validates change structure

**What OpenSpec Doesn't Solve** ❌:
- **No Overall Design**: Where do domain types come from? Who defines actors?
- **No Feature Planning**: How to break a large system into features?
- **No Cross-Feature Validation**: How to ensure features don't duplicate types or contradict each other?
- **No Actor Flows**: How to describe what users do in plain English?
- **No Design Review**: When and how to validate designs before coding?
- **No Dependency Management**: Which features depend on which?

**The Problem with OpenSpec-Only Approach**:

```
Developer creates openspec change 001
   ↓
Implements feature based on their understanding
   ↓
Another developer creates change 002 for different feature
   ↓
Discovers they need same types but defined differently
   ↓
No Overall Design to reference → inconsistency
   ↓
Refactoring needed, wasted time
```

**How FDD + OpenSpec Work Together**:

```
1. FDD: Create Overall Design
   - Define all domain types ONCE
   - Define all API contracts ONCE
   - Define all actors and use cases
   
2. FDD: Generate Features from Overall Design
   - Each feature has complete design
   - Features reference Overall Design (no duplication)
   - Dependencies explicitly tracked
   
3. FDD: Validate Feature Design
   - Check for type redefinitions
   - Validate actor flows
   - Ensure consistency with Overall Design
   
4. OpenSpec: Break feature into atomic changes
   - Each change implements part of validated design
   - Changes reference feature design specs
   - Implementation is traceable
   
5. OpenSpec: Track implementation
   - Archive completed changes
   - Merge specs to source of truth
   - Full audit trail
```

**TL;DR**: OpenSpec manages **how you implement**, FDD defines **what you implement**. You need both for large projects.

### When NOT to Use FDD

FDD adds structure and validation. Skip it if:
- ❌ Prototype/throwaway code (no need for design docs)
- ❌ Trivial changes (single-line fixes)
- ❌ Well-understood patterns (no architectural decisions)

**Use FDD when**:
- ✅ Building production systems
- ✅ Working with AI assistants
- ✅ Need stakeholder review
- ✅ Multiple features with dependencies
- ✅ Long-term maintenance expected

---

## Core Components

### 1. Two-Level Design

**Overall Design** (`architecture/DESIGN.md`):
- System vision and capabilities
- All actors and use cases
- Domain model types (formally specified)
- API contracts (formally specified)
- Architecture diagrams

**Feature Design** (`architecture/features/feature-{slug}/DESIGN.md`):
- What this feature does
- Actor flows (how users interact)
- Algorithms in FDL (plain English logic)
- Technical details (database, security, etc.)
- Testing scenarios

### 2. FDL (FDD Description Language)

Plain English pseudocode for describing logic:

```
1. User submits login form
2. System validates email format
   2.1. IF invalid format
       2.1.1. Show error "Invalid email"
       2.1.2. STOP
3. System checks credentials in database
4. IF credentials match
   4.1. Create session
   4.2. Redirect to dashboard
5. ELSE
   5.1. Show error "Invalid credentials"
```

**Benefits**:
- Non-programmers can review
- Language-agnostic
- Focuses on logic, not syntax

### 3. OpenSpec (Change Management)

Break features into atomic, traceable changes:

```
feature-login/
└── openspec/
    ├── specs/          # Completed changes
    └── changes/        # Active work
        └── 001-authentication/
            ├── proposal.md   # Why
            ├── tasks.md      # What to do
            └── specs/        # Implementation details
```

### 4. Formal Specifications

**DML (Domain Model Language)** - you choose format:
- [GTS](https://github.com/GlobalTypeSystem/gts-spec), [CTI](https://github.com/acronis/go-cti/blob/main/cti-spec/SPEC.md), JSON Schema, RAML, Protobuf etc.
- Must be documented before implementation
- Should be machine-readable and versionable (recommended)

**API Contracts** - you choose format:
- OpenAPI, GraphQL Schema, gRPC, RAML, etc.
- Must be documented before implementation

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Quick Overview (5 minutes)

**Read these files**:
1. `README.md` (this file) - Overview
2. `FDL.md` - Learn plain English algorithm syntax
3. `workflows/README.md` - Understand workflow system

### 2. Add FDD to Your Project (15 minutes)

**Option A: Copy FDD core**

    ]
  }
}
```

## Working with AI Assistants

FDD is designed to work with AI coding assistants (but doesn't require them).

### Setup AI Assistant for FDD

**1. Configure AI to read FDD docs**:

Add to your IDE's AI assistant configuration or user rules:
```
Always read @guidelines/FDD/AGENTS.md for FDD methodology.
Always read @guidelines/{project}-fdd-adapter/AGENTS.md for project-specific patterns.
Follow FDD workflows in @guidelines/FDD/workflows/.
```

**2. Common AI workflows**:

```bash
# Let AI initialize project
"Follow @guidelines/FDD/workflows/01-init-project.md to initialize FDD structure"

# Let AI create feature
"Follow @guidelines/FDD/workflows/05-init-feature.md to create feature-login"

# Let AI validate design
"Follow @guidelines/FDD/workflows/06-validate-feature.md to validate feature-login"

# Let AI implement OpenSpec change
"Follow @guidelines/FDD/workflows/10-openspec-change-implement.md for feature-login change 001"
```

**3. AI limitations**:

AI assistants can:
- ✅ Initialize structures
- ✅ Generate design templates
- ✅ Validate against checklists
- ✅ Implement OpenSpec changes
- ✅ Write tests

Humans must:
- ❌ Define business requirements
- ❌ Make architectural decisions
- ❌ Review actor flows
- ❌ Approve designs
- ❌ Final code review

---

## Team Workflow

**Default**: FDD is designed for a **single expert** (typically an architect) who handles all design and implementation work. The roles below describe abstract responsibilities that can be delegated if desired.

### Roles (can be combined or delegated)

**Technical Lead / Architect** (core role):
- Creates Overall Design
- Reviews all Feature Designs
- Creates project adapter
- Defines validation rules

**Feature Owner** (optional delegation):
- Creates Feature Design
- Breaks feature into OpenSpec changes
- Reviews implementation
- Marks feature complete

**Developer** (optional delegation):
- Implements OpenSpec changes
- Writes tests
- Updates specs after changes

**Stakeholder / QA** (optional review):
- Reviews actor flows (plain English)
- Reviews algorithms in FDL (reviewable)
- Validates business logic

### Process

```
1. Architect creates Overall Design
   ↓ (validated by team)
   
2. Team reviews Overall Design
   ↓ (approved)
   
3. Generate features from Overall Design
   ↓ (FEATURES.md created)
   
4. For each feature:
   4.1. Feature Owner creates DESIGN.md
   4.2. Team reviews actor flows
   4.3. Validate feature design
   4.4. Initialize OpenSpec
   4.5. Developers implement changes
   4.6. Mark feature complete
```

### Design Reviews

**Overall Design Review**:
- All team members review
- Stakeholders review vision and actors
- Technical team validates architecture
- Must score ≥90/100 before proceeding

**Feature Design Review**:
- Feature Owner presents
- Team reviews actor flows (Section B is PRIMARY)
- Algorithms in FDL reviewed by stakeholders
- Technical details reviewed by developers
- Must score 100/100 before implementation

### Implementation

**OpenSpec Change Implementation**:
- Developers pick changes from `openspec/changes/`
- Implement according to `tasks.md`
- Update `specs/` if needed
- Mark complete when tests pass

**Feature Completion**:
- All OpenSpec changes merged
- All tests pass
- Code compiles
- Feature marked ✅ in FEATURES.md

## FAQs

### Do I need AI assistants to use FDD?

**Recommended.** FDD is specifically designed to work with AI assistants that support agentic workflows. While workflows are human-readable, manual execution can be challenging and time-consuming.

**Without AI assistants**:
- You'll need a full team (architect + developers + QA)
- Workflows must be followed manually
- More overhead for validation and tracking

**With AI assistants** (recommended):
- Single expert (architect) can handle entire workflow
- AI follows workflows automatically
- Faster design generation and validation
- AI implements OpenSpec changes

### What tech stack do I need?

**Any.** FDD is technology-agnostic. You choose:
- Domain model format (GTS, CTI, JSON Schema, TypeScript, Protobuf, etc.)
- API format (OpenAPI, RAML, GraphQL, gRPC, etc.)
- Implementation language (JavaScript, Python, Go, etc.)

Your **adapter** documents these choices.

### How long does it take to set up?

- **Add FDD core**: 5 minutes
- **Create adapter**: 1-2 hours (first time)
- **Initialize project**: 30 minutes
- **First feature design**: 1-2 hours

After initial setup, feature design time depends on complexity.

### Can I use FDD with existing projects?

**Yes.** You can:
1. Add FDD to existing project
2. Create adapter for existing tech stack
3. Start documenting new features in FDD
4. Gradually migrate existing features (optional)

### Do I need to use OpenSpec?

**Yes**, OpenSpec is required for change tracking. It provides:
- Atomic, traceable changes
- Clear implementation tasks
- Audit trail
- Rollback capability

Install: `npm install -g @fission-ai/openspec@latest`

### What if my team doesn't know FDD?

Follow the onboarding checklist:
1. **Reading** (30 min): README.md, FDL.md, workflows/README.md
2. **Setup** (15 min): IDE, tools, adapter review
3. **Practice** (2 hours): Review example feature, create small feature with guidance

### How do I validate designs?

Follow validation workflows:
- **Overall Design**: `workflows/02-validate-architecture.md`
- **Feature Design**: `workflows/06-validate-feature.md`

Validation is done via checklists (manual review). AI assistants can help automate checks.

---

## Examples

### Example: Login Feature

**Overall Design** (`architecture/DESIGN.md`):
```markdown
## A. Business Context

### Actors
- **End User**: Person accessing the system

### System Capabilities
- User authentication with email/password
```

**Feature Design** (`architecture/features/feature-login/DESIGN.md`):
```markdown
## B. Actor Flows

### Actor: End User

1. User navigates to login page
2. User enters email and password
3. User clicks "Login" button
4. System validates credentials
5. IF credentials valid
   5.1. System creates session
   5.2. System redirects to dashboard
6. ELSE
   6.1. System shows error "Invalid credentials"
   6.2. User remains on login page
```

**OpenSpec Change** (`architecture/features/feature-login/openspec/changes/001-authentication/`):
```markdown
# proposal.md
Implement user authentication with email/password.

# tasks.md
- [ ] Create User model
- [ ] Create authentication endpoint
- [ ] Add password hashing
- [ ] Add session management
- [ ] Add login page
- [ ] Add tests
```

## Roadmap

### FDD CLI Tool (Planned)

**Goal**: Create an `fdd` CLI tool to automate FDD workflows, similar to how OpenSpec automates change management.

**Why**: Currently, FDD workflows are manual guides that require AI assistants or humans to execute. The `fdd` tool will provide:
- ✅ Automated structure initialization
- ✅ Design validation automation
- ✅ Feature manifest generation
- ✅ Consistency checks across designs
- ✅ Integration with OpenSpec for seamless workflow

**Planned Commands**:
```bash
# Project initialization
fdd init                           # Initialize FDD structure
fdd init --adapter <name>          # Initialize with specific adapter

# Architecture workflows
fdd validate architecture          # Validate Overall Design
fdd validate architecture --report # Generate detailed validation report

# Feature management
fdd features generate              # Generate FEATURES.md from Overall Design
fdd features validate              # Validate FEATURES.md consistency
fdd feature init <slug>            # Initialize new feature
fdd feature validate <slug>        # Validate feature design
fdd feature complete <slug>        # Mark feature as complete

# Design inspection
fdd show architecture              # Show Overall Design summary
fdd show feature <slug>            # Show feature design summary
fdd list features                  # List all features with status
fdd list features --status IN_PROGRESS  # Filter by status

# OpenSpec integration
fdd openspec init <slug>           # Initialize OpenSpec for feature
fdd openspec validate <slug>       # Validate OpenSpec structure

# Validation helpers
fdd check types <slug>             # Check for type redefinitions
fdd check links <slug>             # Check cross-references validity
fdd check fdl <slug>               # Validate FDL syntax
```

**Implementation Approach**:
- **Language**: Node.js/TypeScript (for cross-platform compatibility)
- **Package**: `npm install -g @fdd/cli` or similar
- **Integration**: Works alongside `openspec` CLI tool
- **Adapters**: Support pluggable adapters for different tech stacks

**Timeline**: To be determined based on community feedback and adoption.

**Status**: 📋 Planning phase - gathering requirements and use cases.
