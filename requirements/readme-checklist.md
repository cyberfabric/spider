## Agent Instructions

**ALWAYS open and follow**: This file WHEN validating README.md files

**ALWAYS use**: Review Scope Selection to determine appropriate review mode

**Prerequisite**: Agent confirms understanding before proceeding:
- [ ] Agent has read and understood this checklist
- [ ] Agent has identified the project type and target audience
- [ ] Agent will check ALL items in applicable MUST HAVE sections
- [ ] Agent will verify ALL items in MUST NOT HAVE sections
- [ ] Agent will use the specified reporting format

---

## Review Scope Selection

**Choose review mode based on project type and README scope**:

| Review Mode | When to Use | Sections to Check |
|-------------|-------------|-------------------|
| **Quick** | Minor updates, typo fixes | IDENT (core) + changed sections |
| **Standard** | New README, moderate changes | All applicable sections |
| **Full** | Open-source release, public API | All sections with evidence |

### Quick Review (Core Items Only)

**MUST CHECK** (blocking):
- [ ] IDENT-README-001: Project Identity
- [ ] START-README-001: Installation Instructions
- [ ] USAGE-README-001: Basic Usage Examples
- [ ] MAINT-README-001: License Information

### Project Type Prioritization

| Project Type | Priority Sections | Secondary | Often N/A |
|--------------|-------------------|-----------|-----------|
| **Open Source Library** | IDENT, START, USAGE, COMM, MAINT | TECH | - |
| **Internal Tool** | IDENT, START, USAGE, TECH | MAINT | COMM (external) |
| **API/Service** | IDENT, START, USAGE, TECH | COMM | - |
| **CLI Application** | IDENT, START, USAGE | TECH, COMM | - |
| **Data Project** | IDENT, TECH, USAGE | START | COMM |
| **Documentation-only** | IDENT, ACCESS | USAGE | START, TECH |

---

## Prerequisites

Before starting the review, confirm:

- [ ] I understand this checklist validates README.md files
- [ ] I have access to the full README content
- [ ] I understand the project type and target audience
- [ ] I will check ALL items in MUST HAVE sections
- [ ] I will verify ALL items in MUST NOT HAVE sections
- [ ] I will document any violations found
- [ ] I will provide specific feedback for each failed check

---

## Applicability Context

Before evaluating each checklist item, the expert MUST:

1. **Understand the project type** — What kind of project is this? (library, CLI, API, data project, etc.)

2. **Identify the target audience** — Who will read this README? (developers, end-users, data scientists, etc.)

3. **Determine applicability for each requirement**:
   - A data-only repository may not need installation instructions
   - An internal tool may not need contribution guidelines
   - A CLI tool needs command examples more than API docs

4. **Require explicit handling** — For each checklist item:
   - If applicable: The document MUST address it
   - If not applicable: Should be omitted (no N/A explanation needed in README)
   - If partially applicable: Must cover the relevant parts

**Key principle**: README should be complete for its audience without being bloated

---

## Severity Dictionary

- **CRITICAL**: Missing essential information; users cannot understand or use the project
- **HIGH**: Major gap; significantly impacts user experience
- **MEDIUM**: Meaningful improvement; enhances usability
- **LOW**: Minor improvement; polish

---

# Error Handling

## README File Not Found

**If README.md doesn't exist at expected location**:
```
⚠️ README not found: {path}
→ Expected at: {project_root}/README.md
→ Fix: Create README.md or specify correct path
```
**Action**: STOP — cannot validate non-existent file.

## README Unreadable

**If README file cannot be read**:
```
⚠️ Cannot read README: {path}
→ Check file permissions
→ Verify file encoding is UTF-8
```
**Action**: STOP — cannot validate unreadable file.

## Incomplete README (Partial Content)

**If README is truncated or has obvious missing sections**:
```
⚠️ README appears incomplete
→ File ends abruptly at: {location}
→ Missing expected sections: {list}
→ Fix: Complete the README before validation
```
**Action**: WARN and continue with available content.

## Corrupted Markdown

**If README contains malformed markdown**:
```
⚠️ Markdown parsing errors detected
→ Issues: {list of parsing errors}
→ Fix: Correct markdown syntax before full validation
```
**Action**: WARN and attempt validation, note formatting issues.

## External Links Inaccessible

**If external links cannot be verified**:
```
⚠️ Cannot verify external links (network unavailable)
→ Skipping link validation: IDENT-README-NO-001
→ Manual verification recommended
```
**Action**: Skip link validation, mark as INCOMPLETE in report.
