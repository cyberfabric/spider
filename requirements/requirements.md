# Common Requirements Structure Requirements

**Version**: 1.0  
**Purpose**: Define common requirements shared across FDD structure requirements  
**Scope**: FDD artifact documentation (BUSINESS.md, DESIGN.md, ADR.md, FEATURES.md, feature docs) and adapter spec docs

**ALWAYS open and follow**: `core.md` WHEN editing this file

## Overview

This file defines requirements that are shared across multiple `*-structure.md` requirements files.

**Goal**: Avoid duplication across structure requirements.

**Applies to**:
- Artifact docs:
  - `architecture/BUSINESS.md`
  - `architecture/DESIGN.md`
  - `architecture/ADR.md`
  - `architecture/features/FEATURES.md`
  - `architecture/features/feature-{slug}/DESIGN.md`
  - `architecture/features/feature-{slug}/CHANGES.md`
- Adapter spec docs:
  - `{adapter-directory}/specs/*.md`

**Does NOT apply to**:
- Agent instruction files (AGENTS.md, workflow navigation files)

## Structure

### Links (Artifacts)

**MUST**:
- Use standard Markdown links for file references in artifact docs: `[label]({relative-path})`
- Use relative paths (do not use absolute filesystem paths)
- Ensure links to repository files point to existing files
- Use relative paths that work in standard Markdown renderers

**MUST NOT**:
- Use IDE-specific link notations:
  - `@/path/to/file`
  - `@DESIGN.md`
  - `@BUSINESS.md`
  - `@ADR.md`

### Links (Adapter Spec Docs)

**MUST**:
- Use standard Markdown links for file references in adapter spec docs: `[label]({relative-path})`
- Use relative paths (do not use absolute filesystem paths)
- Ensure links to repository files point to existing files

**MUST NOT**:
- Use IDE-specific link notations:
  - `@/path/to/file`
  - `@DESIGN.md`
  - `@BUSINESS.md`
  - `@ADR.md`

### Link Target Validity (Artifacts)

**MUST**:
- Ensure all file links are clickable and navigable in standard Markdown viewers
- Ensure links do not create broken references

### Placeholders (Artifacts)

**MUST NOT**:
- Use TODO placeholders in artifact docs (e.g., `TODO`, `[TODO]`)
- Use TBD placeholders in artifact docs (e.g., `TBD`, `[TBD]`)
- Use FIXME placeholders in artifact docs (e.g., `FIXME`)
- Use `XXX` markers in artifact docs
- Use HTML comment placeholders in artifact docs (e.g., `<!-- TODO: ... -->`)
- Leave `{placeholder}` content in artifact docs

### Placeholders (Adapter Spec Docs)

**MUST NOT**:
- Use TODO placeholders in adapter spec docs (e.g., `TODO`, `[TODO]`)
- Use TBD placeholders in adapter spec docs (e.g., `TBD`, `[TBD]`)
- Use FIXME placeholders in adapter spec docs (e.g., `FIXME`)
- Use `XXX` markers in adapter spec docs
- Use HTML comment placeholders in adapter spec docs (e.g., `<!-- TODO: ... -->`)
- Leave `{placeholder}` content in adapter spec docs

### Markdown Validity (Artifacts)

**MUST**:
- Use valid Markdown that renders correctly in standard Markdown viewers

**MUST NOT**:
- Use malformed Markdown

### Content Presence (Artifacts)

**MUST**:
- Provide substantive content (not placeholder-only)

**MUST NOT**:
- Leave artifact docs empty
- Leave artifact docs placeholder-only

### Size Limits (Artifacts)

**MUST**:
- Follow size limits defined by the applicable `*-structure.md` requirements file

**MUST** define size limits in a consistent format in the corresponding structure requirements:
- `**Size limits**:` section
- `- Recommended: ...`
- `- Hard limit: ...`

### ID Conventions (FDD IDs)

**Applies to**: Any FDD-scoped ID that starts with `fdd-` in artifact docs and adapter spec docs.

**MUST**:
- Use kebab-case for `fdd-...` IDs
- Keep `fdd-...` IDs unique within the document scope where they are defined
- Wrap `fdd-...` ID values in backticks when written in markdown (e.g., `**ID**: \`fdd-...\``)

**MUST NOT**:
- Use non-kebab-case variants for `fdd-...` IDs
- Use unwrapped (non-backticked) `fdd-...` IDs when written as ID values

### ID Placement (Artifacts)

**Applies to**: Any artifact doc section where a heading is followed by an `**ID**:` line.

**MUST**:
- Insert exactly one blank line between the heading and the `**ID**:` line
- Use `**ID**: \`fdd-...\`` format

**MUST NOT**:
- Place the `**ID**:` line immediately after the heading (no blank line)

### ID Payload Blocks (Artifacts)

**Applies to**: Any artifact doc line that defines an FDD ID using `**ID**: \`fdd-...\``.

**MUST**:
- Include a deterministic payload block delimited by `<!-- fdd-id-content -->` immediately after the `**ID**:` line (allowing optional blank lines)
- Close the payload block with a matching `<!-- fdd-id-content -->` line
- Keep the payload block content inside the delimiters (payload MAY be empty)
  - Ensure the payload block contains all content of the enclosing element
    - Enclosing element content MUST be computed as all lines after the element heading until the next heading of the same level or higher
    - Enclosing element content MAY contain multiple `**ID**:` blocks; each `**ID**:` starts a new element
    - For each element: no non-empty lines are allowed outside the payload block until the next `**ID**:` line or the enclosing element boundary

**MUST NOT**:
- Place any content for an `**ID**:` outside the payload block
- Use unmatched payload delimiters

### Section Heading Format (Artifacts)

**Applies to**: Artifact docs that use lettered top-level sections (A, B, C, ...).

**MUST**:
- Use `## {LETTER}. {Title}` for top-level sections (e.g., `## A. Vision`)

**MUST NOT**:
- Use the `## Section {LETTER}: {Title}` format (e.g., `## Section A: Vision`)

### Validation Scoring (Structure Requirements)

**Applies to**: Any `*-structure.md` file that defines a scoring system for validating an artifact.

**MUST**:
- Use a 100-point scoring scale when scoring is used
- Declare pass threshold in `/100` terms (e.g., `≥90/100`)

### Validation Report Format (Structure Validators)

**Applies to**: Any workflow validator output that reports validation results for artifacts.

**MUST**:
- Include an `Issues` section listing missing/invalid items
- Include a `Recommendations` section describing what to fix

**MUST** include these fields when they are part of the validation model:
- `Score: X/100`
- `Completeness: X%`

### Section Ordering (Structure Requirements)

**Applies to**: Any `*-structure.md` file that defines an ordered set of top-level sections (e.g., A/B/C, 1/2/3).

**MUST**:
- Define the required top-level section order as a single ordered sequence (e.g., `A → B → C`)
- Explicitly state which sections are optional (if any) and where they are allowed to appear in the sequence

**MUST NOT**:
- Allow ambiguous ordering rules
