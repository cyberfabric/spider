# OpenSpec Change Structure Requirements

**Purpose**: Define required structure for OpenSpec changes in `openspec/changes/{change-name}/`

**Used by**:
- Workflow 09 (openspec-change-next): Create new OpenSpec change
- Workflow 12 (openspec-validate): Validate OpenSpec structure

**Note**: OpenSpec changes are atomic implementation units (1-5 requirements per change)

---

## Naming Convention

**Spec Name Format**: `fdd-{project-name}-{feature-slug}-feature`

**Components**:
- `fdd-` - Prefix indicating FDD methodology
- `{project-name}` - Project name in kebab-case (from project context)
- `-{feature-slug}-` - Feature identifier
- `feature` - Suffix indicating feature specification

**Example**: `fdd-payment-system-user-auth-feature`

---

## Change Directory Structure

**Location**: `openspec/changes/{change-name}/`

**Change Name Requirement**: 
- **MUST match** change name defined in Feature DESIGN.md Section G (Implementation Plan)
- Format: `fdd-{project-name}-feature-{feature-slug}-change-{short-name}`
- This ensures traceability from Feature Design to OpenSpec implementation

**Required files**:
1. `proposal.md` - Change description and justification
2. `tasks.md` - Implementation tasks checklist
3. `specs/{spec-name}/spec.md` - Technical specification for feature
   - `{spec-name}` MUST follow Spec Name Format: `fdd-{project-name}-{feature-slug}-feature`
   - Example: `specs/fdd-payment-system-user-auth-feature/spec.md`
4. `design.md` - Reference file to Feature DESIGN.md (required)

---

## File: proposal.md

**Purpose**: Describe what will be changed and why

**Required sections**:
1. **Change Name**: Unique identifier (kebab-case)
   - **MUST match exactly** the change name in Feature DESIGN.md Section G
   - Format: `fdd-{project-name}-feature-{feature-slug}-change-{short-name}`
   - **MUST be clickable link** to Feature DESIGN.md Section G
   - Format: `[change-name](../../architecture/features/feature-{slug}/DESIGN.md#section-g-implementation-plan)`
2. **Feature**: Feature slug this change belongs to
   - **MUST match** the feature slug from Feature DESIGN.md directory name
   - Example: if DESIGN.md is in `feature-user-auth/`, Feature must be `user-auth`
   - **MUST be clickable link** to Feature DESIGN.md
   - Format: `[feature-slug](../../architecture/features/feature-{slug}/DESIGN.md)`
3. **Implements Requirements**: List of requirement IDs from Feature DESIGN.md Section F
   - **MUST use exact requirement IDs** from Section F (not invented or paraphrased)
   - Format: `fdd-{project-name}-feature-{feature-slug}-req-{short-name}`
   - Each ID must exist in Feature DESIGN.md Section F
   - **Each ID MUST be clickable link** to Feature DESIGN.md Section F
   - Format: `[req-id](../../architecture/features/feature-{slug}/DESIGN.md#section-f-requirements)`
4. **Description**: Clear description of what will be implemented
5. **Justification**: Why this change is needed
6. **Dependencies**: Other changes this depends on (or "None")
7. **Status**: ⏳ NOT_STARTED, 🔄 IN_PROGRESS, or ✅ COMPLETED

**Validation**:
- Change Name matches Feature DESIGN.md Section G exactly
- Feature slug matches feature directory
- Implements 1-5 requirements
- All requirement IDs exist in Feature DESIGN.md Section F
- Dependencies are valid change names from Section G

---

## File: tasks.md

**Purpose**: Checklist of implementation tasks

**Format**: Markdown checklist with task descriptions

**Requirements**:
- ≥3 tasks per change
- **MUST include task**: "Create tests for Testing Scenarios from Feature Design Section F"
- Tasks specific and actionable
- Clear completion criteria
- No vague tasks like "Implement feature"

**Mandatory Test Task**:
Every change MUST include a task for implementing tests based on Testing Scenarios from Feature Design Section F. Format:
```markdown
- [ ] Create tests for Testing Scenarios from Feature Design Section F
```

**Example**:
```markdown
- [ ] Create domain type definitions
- [ ] Implement validation logic
- [ ] Create tests for Testing Scenarios from Feature Design Section F
- [ ] Update API documentation
```

---

## File: specs/{spec-name}/spec.md

**Path Format**: `specs/{spec-name}/spec.md`
- `{spec-name}` MUST follow Spec Name Format: `fdd-{project-name}-{feature-slug}-feature`
- Example: `specs/fdd-payment-system-user-auth-feature/spec.md`

**Purpose**: Technical specification for implementation

**Required sections**:
1. **Overview**: What this spec defines
   - **MUST include clickable link** to Feature DESIGN.md
   - Format: `[Feature DESIGN.md](../../architecture/features/feature-{slug}/DESIGN.md)`
   - This provides context and traceability to feature requirements
2. **Domain Model Changes**: Types/schemas added or modified
3. **API Changes**: Endpoints added or modified
4. **Implementation Notes**: Technical details for developers
5. **Testing Requirements**: What must be tested

**Validation**:
- Directory name matches Spec Name Format exactly
- Spec name matches feature being implemented
- References Feature DESIGN.md sections
- No contradictions with Overall Design
- Sufficient detail for implementation

---

## File: design.md

**Purpose**: Reference file linking to Feature DESIGN.md and mapping to implementation

**MANDATORY for all changes**

**Required content**:
1. **Reference to Feature DESIGN.md**: `[Feature DESIGN.md](../../architecture/features/feature-{slug}/DESIGN.md)`
2. **Requirements list**: List all requirement IDs from Feature Design Section F that this change implements
3. **Testing Scenarios reference**: Explicitly state that tests must implement Testing Scenarios from Feature Design Section F
4. **Implementation mapping** (optional): Map Feature Design elements to code modules

**Agent Instruction**:
- **MUST READ** Feature DESIGN.md before working on this change
- **MUST implement** Testing Scenarios from Section F as actual test code
- This file enforces design-to-code traceability

**Validation**:
- File must exist (not optional)
- Must contain link to Feature DESIGN.md
- Must reference Section F requirements
- Must mention Testing Scenarios

## Change Lifecycle

**States**:
1. **⏳ NOT_STARTED**: Change created, not yet started

3. **✅ COMPLETED**: Implementation finished, tested, archived

**State transitions**:
- NOT_STARTED → IN_PROGRESS: Start implementation (workflow 10)
- IN_PROGRESS → COMPLETED: Complete implementation (workflow 11)

**Archive location**: `openspec/changes/archive/{change-name}/`
