**Actor ID Format**: `fdd-{project-name}-actor-{actor-name}`

**Components**:
- `fdd-` - Prefix indicating FDD methodology
- `{project-name}` - Project name in kebab-case
- `-actor-` - Actor indicator
- `{actor-name}` - Actor name in kebab-case (2-3 words)

**Examples**: 
- `fdd-payment-system-actor-admin`
- `fdd-analytics-actor-data-analyst`
- `fdd-analytics-actor-ui-app` (system actor)

**Format per actor**:
```markdown
#### Actor Name
**ID**: `fdd-project-actor-name`  
**Role**: Description of what this actor does
```

**Required content per actor**:
- **Actor Name**: Clear, descriptive name (#### heading)
- **ID**: Unique identifier (must be first line after heading, wrapped in backticks)
- **Role**: What this actor does (1-2 sentences)
- **NO Capabilities**: Capabilities are in Section C

**Content requirements**:
- Each actor must have unique ID
- ID appears immediately after actor name heading
- Role description only (no capabilities list)
- Plain English, no technical jargon
- Distinguish between human and system actors

**Example**:
```markdown
## Section B: Actors

**Human Actors**:

#### Platform Administrator
**ID**: `fdd-analytics-actor-platform-admin`

### Section C: Capabilities

**Purpose**: Define system capabilities and which actors use them

**Structure**:
- Each capability is a #### heading
- Capability ID immediately after heading

**Capability ID Format**: `fdd-{project-name}-capability-{capability-name}`

**Components**:
- `fdd-` - Prefix indicating FDD methodology
- `{project-name}` - Project name in kebab-case
- `-capability-` - Capability indicator
- `{capability-name}` - Capability name in kebab-case (2-4 words)

**Examples**:

## Best Practices

1. **Keep it business-focused**
   - Focus on business problems and value
   - Avoid technical implementation details
   - Use plain English, not jargon

2. **Actor definitions**
   - Distinguish between human and system actors
   - Keep role descriptions concise (1-2 sentences)
   - Focus on "who" not "how"

3. **Capability definitions**
   - Group related features under one capability
   - Keep capability scope broad but coherent
   - List actor IDs that use each capability

4. **Success criteria**
   - Make them measurable
   - Include quantitative targets
   - Focus on business outcomes

5. **ID naming**
   - Use descriptive names (2-4 words)
   - Keep consistent with domain language
   - Use kebab-case
   - Always wrap in backticks

## Examples

**Valid BUSINESS.md structure**:
```markdown
# Business Context

## A. Vision

Provide analytics platform for tracking user behavior...

## B. Actors

### Admin User
**ID**: `fdd-actor-admin`
Administrator managing the system...

### Data Analyst
**ID**: `fdd-actor-analyst`
Analyzes user behavior data...

## C. Capabilities

### Analytics Dashboard
**ID**: `fdd-capability-dashboard`
**Actors**: `fdd-actor-admin`, `fdd-actor-analyst`

View and analyze user behavior metrics...
```

**Invalid BUSINESS.md**:
```markdown
# Business Stuff

Some information about the business.

We have users and admins.
```

**Issues**: No structured sections, no IDs, no clear actors/capabilities definition
