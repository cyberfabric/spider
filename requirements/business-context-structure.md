## Best Practices

1. **Keep it business-focused**
   - Focus on business problems and value
   - Avoid technical implementation details
   - Use plain English, not jargon

2. **Actor definitions**
   - Distinguish between human and system actors
   - Keep role descriptions concise (1-2 sentences)
   - Focus on "who" not "how"

3. **Capability definitions**
   - Group related features under one capability
   - Keep capability scope broad but coherent
   - List actor IDs that use each capability

4. **Success criteria**
   - Make them measurable
   - Include quantitative targets
   - Focus on business outcomes

5. **ID naming**
   - Use descriptive names (2-4 words)
   - Keep consistent with domain language
   - Use kebab-case
   - Always wrap in backticks

---

## Examples

**Valid BUSINESS.md**:
- ALWAYS open `examples/requirements/business-context/valid.md` WHEN creating or editing `architecture/BUSINESS.md`

**Issues**:
- Missing required section structure (A/B/C headings and required content)
- Actor headings must be `####` and grouped by Human/System actors
- Actor IDs use wrong format (must be `fdd-{project-name}-actor-{actor-name}`) and must be wrapped in backticks
- Actor metadata should be formatted as separate render-safe lines (prefer markdown lists)
- Capabilities section is missing (no capability IDs, no actor references)

## Validation Checklist

- [ ] Document follows required structure
- [ ] All validation criteria pass
