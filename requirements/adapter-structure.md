# FDD Adapter Structure Requirements

**ALWAYS open and follow**: `../workflows/adapter.md`
**ALWAYS open and follow**: `requirements.md`
**ALWAYS open and follow**: `core.md` WHEN editing this file
**ALWAYS open and follow**: `core.md` WHEN editing adapter artifacts

**This file defines**: Structure only (WHAT to create)  
**Workflow defines**: Process (HOW to create)

⚠️ **Do NOT use this file alone. Execute the workflow, not just the structure.**

---

**Version**: 1.0  
**Purpose**: Define structure and validation criteria for FDD Adapter

**Scope**: Project-specific adapter configuration that extends FDD core methodology

---

## Overview

**FDD Adapter** - Dynamic project-specific configuration that evolves with the project

**Philosophy**: 
- Adapter specs **derive from design decisions**, not predefined templates
- Technical decisions appear during design → captured in adapter
- Existing projects → adapter discovers patterns from code/docs/ADRs
- Greenfield projects → adapter starts minimal, grows with design

**Purpose**: Capture and formalize project-specific technical decisions:
- Tech stack (languages, frameworks, databases)
- Architecture patterns (discovered from design/code)
- Domain model format (determined during design)
- API contract format (determined during design)
- Code conventions (discovered from existing code or defined during development)
- Build/deploy practices (from configs or ADRs)
- Testing strategy (from design or existing tests)

**Lifecycle**:
1. **Bootstrap**: Minimal AGENTS.md with `Extends` only
2. **Discovery** (existing project): Scan code/docs/ADRs → propose specs
3. **Evolution** (during design): Design decisions → update adapter specs
4. **Refinement** (during implementation): Code patterns → update adapter specs

**Directory Name**: `FDD-Adapter/` is **default**, but user can customize
- Default name: `FDD-Adapter/` (recommended for consistency)
- Custom names: `.fdd-adapter/`, `project-adapter/`, etc. (any name works)
- Name is configured in `.fdd-config.json` via `fddAdapterPath` field

**Common locations**:
- `{project-root}/FDD-Adapter/` (default, recommended)
- `{project-root}/.fdd-adapter/` (hidden directory style)
- `{project-root}/guidelines/FDD-Adapter/` (documentation organization)
- `{project-root}/spec/FDD-Adapter/` (technical specs organization)
- `{project-root}/docs/FDD-Adapter/` (documentation organization)
- Custom: any directory name at project root

**Important**: 
- Adapter MUST be discoverable via `.fdd-config.json`
- Avoid deep nesting in subdirectories
- Use consistent naming within your organization

**Bootstrap Structure**:
```
{project-root}/
├── .fdd-config.json       # Project configuration (mandatory)
│                          # Contains: {"fddAdapterPath": "FDD-Adapter"}
│                          # Optional: {"codeScanning": {...}}
│                          # User can change adapter name to any directory

## Required Files

### .fdd-config.json

**Location**: `{project-root}/.fdd-config.json`

**Purpose**: Project-level FDD configuration for discoverability

**Mandatory fields**:
```json
{
  "fddAdapterPath": "FDD-Adapter"
}
```

**Optional fields**:
```json
{
  "fddAdapterPath": "FDD-Adapter",
  "fddCorePath": ".fdd",
  "codeScanning": {
    "fileExtensions": [".py", ".js", ".ts", ".go", ".rs"],
    "singleLineComments": ["#", "//", "--"],
    "multiLineComments": [
      {"start": "/*", "end": "*/"},
      {"start": "<!--", "end": "-->"}
    ],
    "blockCommentPrefixes": ["*"]
  }
}
```

**Validation**:
- [ ] File exists at project root
- [ ] Valid JSON format
- [ ] `fddAdapterPath` field present
- [ ] Path points to existing directory with AGENTS.md
- [ ] Config is used by `fdd adapter-info` for discovery
- [ ] If `codeScanning` present, all fields are valid arrays/objects

**Notes**:
- Config ensures reliable adapter discovery
- Allows custom adapter locations
- Required for multi-module projects
- Speeds up adapter search (no recursive scan)
- `codeScanning` enables FDD to work with any programming language
- If `codeScanning` omitted, sensible defaults are used (Python, JS/TS, Go, Rust, Java, etc.)

### AGENTS.md

**Location**: `{adapter-directory}/AGENTS.md`

**Purpose**: Adapter-specific navigation for AI agents (MUST WHEN format)

ALWAYS add to the header of AGENTS.md:

  ```markdown
  **ALWAYS open and follow**: `{FDD directory / submodule}/requirements/core.md` WHEN editing this file
  ```

**Adapter AGENTS.md WHEN rule (mandatory)**:
- Each navigation rule MUST use a WHEN clause that is ONLY a list of FDD workflows.
- The WHEN clause MUST NOT use generic conditions like "working with domain types".
- Allowed canonical form:
  - `ALWAYS open and follow {spec-file} WHEN executing workflows: {workflow1.md}, {workflow2.md}, ...`

**Two Phases**:

#### Phase 1: Bootstrap (Minimal)
**When**: Project initialization, no design yet
```markdown
# FDD Adapter: {Project Name}

**Extends**: `../FDD/AGENTS.md`
```

**That's it.** No specs, no MUST rules yet.

#### Phase 2: With Specs (After Discovery/Design)
**When**: After discovery workflow OR after design decisions
```markdown
# FDD Adapter: {Project Name}

**Extends**: `../FDD/AGENTS.md`

**Version**: {version}  
**Last Updated**: YYYY-MM-DD  
**Tech Stack**: {Primary language/framework}

---

```

**Note**: Navigation rules are added **only after** corresponding spec files are created

**Specification Files** (created dynamically in `specs/`):

| Spec File | Created From | Contains |
|-----------|--------------|----------|
| `tech-stack.md` | DESIGN.md + ADRs + discovery | Languages, frameworks, databases, versions |
| `domain-model.md` | DESIGN.md Section C.2 + ADRs | Schema format, entity structure, examples |
| `api-contracts.md` | DESIGN.md Section C.3 + ADRs | Contract format, endpoint patterns, examples |
| `patterns.md` | Design decisions + code analysis | Architecture patterns, when to use, examples |
| `conventions.md` | Code analysis + ADRs + configs | Naming, style, file organization |
| `build-deploy.md` | Configs + ADRs + discovery | Build commands, CI/CD, deployment steps |
| `testing.md` | Test code + ADRs + discovery | Test frameworks, structure, commands |
| `language-config.md` | Project language stack + file analysis | File extensions, comment formats for code scanning |
| `linting.md` | Linter configs + ADRs | Linting rules, tools, custom lints |
| `security.md` | Security requirements + ADRs | Auth, validation, encryption, audit logging |
| `performance.md` | Performance requirements + ADRs | Benchmarks, profiling, optimization guidelines |

| `snippets/{category}.md` | Implementation code | Reusable code snippets, utilities |
| `examples/{feature}.md` | Feature implementations | Pattern usage examples from features |

**Required spec structure** (applies to all spec files):

Each spec file MUST include:

1. **Header**: Version, Purpose, Scope
2. **Content sections**: Specific to spec type
3. **Validation criteria**: Checklist for agent self-verification
4. **Examples**: Valid and invalid examples with ✅/❌

**Validation criteria format**:
```markdown
## Validation Checklist

Agent MUST verify before implementation:
- [ ] Criterion 1: {specific check}
- [ ] Criterion 2: {specific check}
- [ ] Criterion 3: {specific check}

**Self-test**:
- [ ] Did I check all criteria?
- [ ] Are examples concrete and project-specific?
- [ ] Do commands work on target platform?
```

**Purpose**: Enable systematic agent self-checking during workflow execution

**Common spec categories**:
- **Core specs**: tech-stack, domain-model, api-contracts, conventions, testing, build-deploy
- **Quality specs**: linting, security, performance, architectural-lints
- **Structure specs**: project-structure, patterns, module-creation
- **API specs**: rest-api-guidelines (for REST APIs), graphql-guidelines (for GraphQL), cli-spec (for CLI tools)

**Creation triggers** (see adapter workflow)
