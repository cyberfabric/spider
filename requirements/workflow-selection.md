# Workflow Selection Guide

## Prerequisite Checklist

- [ ] Agent has read and understood this requirement
- [ ] Agent will follow the rules defined here

---


## Overview

This guide helps you select the correct FDD workflow based on:
- Current project state
- Artifacts that exist or need creation
- Phase of development

**All workflows located in**: `/FDD/workflows/`

---

## ⚠️ FIRST STEP: Check for FDD Adapter

**BEFORE selecting any workflow**:

1. Check if `FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md` exists at project root level
2. Check these locations (in order):
   - `{project-root}/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md` (recommended)
   - `{project-root}/guidelines/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md`
   - `{project-root}/spec/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md`
   - `{project-root}/docs/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md`

**Important**: Adapter MUST be at project root level, NOT deeply nested in subdirectories

**If NO adapter** → Start with `adapter.md` workflow

**If adapter exists** → Continue to workflow selection below

---

## Available Workflows

### Phase 0: Adapter Setup

**adapter.md** - Create or update FDD adapter

START
│
├─ No adapter?
│  └─> adapter.md (or adapter-from-sources.md for legacy)
│
├─ Adapter exists, no BUSINESS.md?
│  └─> business-context.md → business-validate.md
│
├─ BUSINESS.md exists, no DESIGN.md?
│  └─> design.md → design-validate.md
│
├─ Need to document decisions?

│  └─> feature-changes.md → feature-changes-validate.md
│
├─ CHANGES.md validated, ready to code?

## Common Sequences

### New project from scratch
```
adapter → adapter-validate
  ↓
business-context → business-validate
  ↓
design → design-validate
  ↓
[optional: adr → adr-validate]
  ↓

  ↓
feature → feature-validate (for each feature)
  ↓
feature-changes → feature-changes-validate
  ↓
 feature-change-implement (for each change)

  ↓
[reverse-engineer existing docs or create new]
  ↓
design → design-validate
  ↓

```

### Add feature to existing project
```
[adapter + design already exist]
  ↓
features → features-validate (update manifest)
  ↓
feature → feature-validate
  ↓
feature-changes → feature-changes-validate
  ↓
 feature-change-implement (repeat)
   ↓
 feature-code-validate
```

### Update existing design

[if impacts features: update feature designs]
  ↓
feature (UPDATE mode) → feature-validate
```

## Critical Rules

**Before executing any workflow**:
1. Read the workflow `.md` file completely
2. Check prerequisites in workflow file
3. Read `requirements/{requirement}.md` files referenced in workflow
4. Read adapter AGENTS.md if workflow requires it

**During execution**:
- Follow steps in sequence
- Validate after creation/update
- One workflow at a time
- Run from project root

**Validation**:
- Always run validation workflow after creation/update
- Meet score thresholds before proceeding
- Re-validate after fixes

**Modes**:
- Most workflows support CREATE or UPDATE modes
- CREATE: Generate new file from scratch
- UPDATE: Modify existing file

## Workflow Resolution Algorithm

Algorithm for resolving user request to workflow file path is implemented throughout this document via keyword matching and routing logic.

Key steps:
- Extract keywords from request
- Initialize workflow candidates
- Return appropriate workflow based on request type (adapter, business, design, feature, validate, changes, implement)
