# Workflow Selection Guide

**Version**: 2.0  
**Purpose**: Select appropriate FDD workflow based on project state  
**Scope**: All FDD workflow selection decisions

---

## Overview

This guide helps you select the correct FDD workflow based on:
- Current project state
- Artifacts that exist or need creation
- Phase of development

**All workflows located in**: `guidelines/FDD/workflows/`

---

## ⚠️ FIRST STEP: Check for FDD Adapter

**BEFORE selecting any workflow**:

1. Check if `{adapter-directory}/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md` exists
2. Common locations:
   - `spec/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md`
   - `guidelines/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md`  
   - `docs/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md`

**If NO adapter** → Start with `adapter.md` workflow

**If adapter exists** → Continue to workflow selection below

- **Next**: `feature-change-validate`

**feature-change-validate.md** - Validate change implementation

- **Validates**: Code compiles, tests pass, requirements met
- **Next**: `feature-change-implement` (next change) or `feature-qa`

**feature-qa.md** - Feature quality assurance
- **Use when**: All changes implemented
- **Validates**: End-to-end feature functionality, integration
- **Next**: Archive CHANGES.md or continue features

│  └─> adapter.md (or adapter-from-sources.md for legacy)
│
├─ Adapter exists, no BUSINESS.md?
│  └─> business-context.md → business-validate.md
│
├─ BUSINESS.md exists, no DESIGN.md?

## Common Sequences

### New project from scratch
```
adapter → adapter-validate
  ↓
business-context → business-validate
  ↓
design → design-validate
  ↓
[optional: adr → adr-validate]
  ↓
features → features-validate
  ↓
feature → feature-validate (for each feature)
  ↓
feature-changes → feature-changes-validate
  ↓
feature-change-implement → feature-change-validate (for each change)
  ↓
feature-qa
```

### Legacy project integration
```
adapter-from-sources → adapter-validate
  ↓
[reverse-engineer existing docs or create new]
  ↓
design → design-validate
  ↓
[continue as new project]
```

### Add feature to existing project
```
[adapter + design already exist]
  ↓
features → features-validate (update manifest)
  ↓
feature → feature-validate
  ↓
feature-changes → feature-changes-validate
  ↓
feature-change-implement → feature-change-validate (repeat)
  ↓
feature-qa
```

### Update existing design
```
design (UPDATE mode) → design-validate
  ↓
[if impacts features: update feature designs]
  ↓
feature (UPDATE mode) → feature-validate
```

## Critical Rules

**Before executing any workflow**:
1. Read the workflow `.md` file completely
2. Check prerequisites in workflow file
3. Read `requirements/{requirement}.md` files referenced in workflow
4. Read adapter AGENTS.md if workflow requires it

**During execution**:
- Follow steps in sequence
- Validate after creation/update
- One workflow at a time
- Run from project root

**Validation**:
- Always run validation workflow after creation/update
- Meet score thresholds before proceeding
- Re-validate after fixes

**Modes**:
- Most workflows support CREATE or UPDATE modes
- CREATE: Generate new file from scratch
- UPDATE: Modify existing file

**Design system architecture**
→ `design.md` → `design-validate.md`

**Record architectural decisions**
→ `adr.md` → `adr-validate.md`

**Plan features**
→ `features.md` → `features-validate.md`

**Design a feature**
→ `feature.md` → `feature-validate.md`

**Plan feature implementation**
→ `feature-changes.md` → `feature-changes-validate.md`

**Implement a change**
→ `feature-change-implement.md` → `feature-change-validate.md`

**Test feature end-to-end**
