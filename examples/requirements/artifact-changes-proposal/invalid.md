# Artifact Changes Proposal

## ADD

**ID**: fdd-taskflow-actor-admin

**Role**: System administrator.

This is intentionally invalid:
- Missing **Artifacts** list declaring which files will be modified
- Missing `---` separator before operation section
- ID not backticked (should be `fdd-taskflow-actor-admin`)
- Content missing `<!-- fdd-id-content -->` markers around payload
