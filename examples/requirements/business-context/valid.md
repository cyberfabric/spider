# Business Context

## A. Vision

**Purpose**: TaskFlow is a lightweight task management system for small teams, enabling task creation, assignment, and progress tracking with real-time notifications.

The system focuses on simplicity and speed, allowing teams to manage their daily work without the overhead of complex project management tools. TaskFlow bridges the gap between simple to-do lists and enterprise-grade solutions.

**Target Users**:
- Team leads managing sprints
- Developers tracking daily work
- Project managers monitoring progress

**Key Problems Solved**:
- Scattered task tracking across multiple tools
- Lack of visibility into team workload
- Missing deadline notifications

**Success Criteria**:
- Tasks created and assigned in under 30 seconds
- Real-time status updates visible to all team members
- Overdue task alerts delivered within 1 minute
