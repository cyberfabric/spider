# Features

### Task Management

- Create and edit tasks
- Assign to users

This is intentionally invalid:
- Title missing project name (should be `# Features: TaskFlow`)
- Missing **Status Overview** line with counts
- Missing **Meaning** block with status emoji definitions
- Feature entry missing required format: ID link, status emoji, priority
- Missing required fields: Purpose, Status, Depends On, Blocks, Scope, Requirements Covered, Phases
