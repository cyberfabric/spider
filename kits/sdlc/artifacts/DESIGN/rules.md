**Dependencies**:
- `template.md` — required structure

- `../../constraints.json` — kit-level constraints (primary rules for ID definitions/references)
- `{cypilot_path}/requirements/kit-constraints.md` — constraints specification
- `{cypilot_path}/schemas/kit-constraints.schema.json` — constraints JSON Schema

## Requirements

Agent confirms understanding of requirements:

### Structural Requirements

- [ ] DESIGN follows `template.md` structure
- [ ] Artifact frontmatter (optional): use `cpt:` format for document metadata
- [ ] All required sections present and non-empty
- [ ] All IDs follow `cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-{kind}-{slug}` convention (see artifacts.json for hierarchy)
- [ ] References to PRD are valid
- [ ] No placeholder content (TODO, TBD, FIXME)
- [ ] No duplicate IDs within document

### Versioning Requirements

- [ ] When editing existing DESIGN: increment version in frontmatter
- [ ] When changing type/component definition: add `-v{N}` suffix to ID or increment existing version
- [ ] Format: `cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-type-{slug}-v2`, `cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-comp-{slug}-v3`, etc.
- [ ] Keep changelog of significant changes

### Semantic Requirements

**Reference**: `checklist.md` for detailed semantic criteria

- [ ] Architecture overview is complete and clear
- [ ] Domain model defines all core types
- [ ] Components have clear responsibilities and boundaries
- [ ] Integration points documented
- [ ] ADR references provided for key decisions
- [ ] PRD capabilities traced to components

### DESIGN Scope Guidelines

**One DESIGN per system/subsystem**. Match scope to architectural boundaries.

| Scope | Examples | Guideline |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Too broad** | "Entire platform design" for 50+ components | Split into subsystem DESIGNs |
| **Right size** | "Auth subsystem design" covering auth components | Clear boundary, manageable size |
| **Too narrow** | "Login button component design" | Implementation detail, use SPEC |

**DESIGN-worthy content**:
- System/subsystem architecture overview
- Domain model (core types, relationships)
- Component responsibilities and boundaries
- Integration points and contracts
- Key architectural decisions (reference ADRs)

**NOT DESIGN-worthy** (use SPEC instead):
- Individual spec implementation details
- UI flows and interactions
- Algorithm pseudo-code
- Test scenarios

**Relationship to other artifacts**:
- **PRD** → DESIGN: PRD defines WHAT, DESIGN defines HOW (high-level)
- **DESIGN** → DECOMPOSITION: DESIGN defines architecture, DECOMPOSITION lists implementations
- **DESIGN** → SPEC: DESIGN provides context, SPEC details implementation

### Upstream Traceability

- [ ] When component fully implemented → mark component `[x]` in DESIGN
- [ ] When all components for ADR implemented → update ADR status (PROPOSED → ACCEPTED)
- [ ] When all design elements for PRD capability implemented → mark capability `[x]` in PRD

### Constraints (`constraints.json`) — Mandatory

- [ ] ALWAYS open and follow `../../constraints.json` (kit root)
- [ ] Treat `constraints.json` as primary validator for:
  - where IDs are defined
  - where IDs are referenced
  - which cross-artifact references are required / optional / prohibited

**References**:
- `{cypilot_path}/requirements/kit-constraints.md`
- `{cypilot_path}/schemas/kit-constraints.schema.json`

**Validation Checks**:
- `cypilot validate` enforces `defined-id[].references` rules (required / optional / prohibited)
- `cypilot validate` enforces headings scoping for ID definitions/references when constraints specify `headings`
- `cypilot validate` enforces "checked ref implies checked def" consistency

## Tasks

Agent executes tasks during generation:

### Phase 1: Setup

- [ ] Load `template.md` for structure
- [ ] Load `checklist.md` for semantic guidance
- [ ] Load `examples/example.md` for reference style
- [ ] Read parent PRD for context

**If PRD not found or incomplete**:
```
⚠ Parent PRD not found or incomplete
→ Option 1: Run /cypilot-generate PRD first (recommended)
→ Option 2: Continue without PRD (DESIGN will lack traceability)
   - Document "PRD pending" in DESIGN frontmatter
   - Skip PRD reference validation
   - Plan to update DESIGN when PRD available
```

**If PRD exists but outdated**:
```
⚠ PRD may be outdated (last modified: {date})
→ Review PRD before proceeding
→ If PRD needs updates: /cypilot-generate PRD UPDATE
→ If PRD is current: proceed with DESIGN
```

### Phase 2: Content Creation

**Apply checklist.md semantics during creation:**

| Checklist Section | Generation Task |
|-------------------|-----------------|
| ARCH-DESIGN-001: Architecture Overview | Document system purpose, high-level architecture, context diagram |
| ARCH-DESIGN-002: Principles Coherence | Define actionable, non-contradictory principles |
| DOMAIN-DESIGN-001: Domain Model | Define types, relationships, boundaries |
| COMP-DESIGN-001: Component Design | Define responsibilities, interfaces, dependencies |

**Partial Completion Handling**:

If DESIGN cannot be completed in a single session:

1. **Checkpoint progress**:
   - Note completed sections (Architecture, Domain, Components, etc.)
   - Note current section being worked on
   - List remaining sections
2. **Ensure valid intermediate state**:
   - All completed sections must be internally consistent
   - Add `status: DRAFT` to frontmatter
   - Mark incomplete sections with `<!-- INCOMPLETE: {reason} -->`
3. **Document resumption point**:
   ```
   DESIGN checkpoint:
   - Completed: Architecture Overview, Domain Model
   - In progress: Component Design (3/7 components)
   - Remaining: Sequences, Data Model
   - Resume: Continue with component cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-comp-{slug}
   ```
4. **On resume**:
   - Verify PRD unchanged since last session
   - Continue from documented checkpoint
   - Remove incomplete markers as sections are finished

### Phase 3: IDs and References

- [ ] Generate type IDs: `cpt-{hierarchy-prefix}-type-{slug}` (e.g., `cpt-myapp-type-user-entity`)
- [ ] Generate component IDs (if needed)
- [ ] Link to PRD actors/capabilities
- [ ] Reference relevant ADRs
- [ ] Verify uniqueness with `cypilot list-ids`

### Phase 4: Quality Check

- [ ] Self-review against `checklist.md` MUST HAVE items
- [ ] Ensure no MUST NOT HAVE violations
- [ ] Verify PRD traceability

---

## Validation

Validation workflow applies rules in two phases:

### Phase 1: Structural Validation (Deterministic)

Run `cypilot validate` for:
- [ ] Template structure compliance
- [ ] ID format validation
- [ ] Cross-reference validity
- [ ] No placeholders

### Phase 2: Semantic Validation (Checklist-based)

Apply `checklist.md` systematically:

1. **Read checklist.md** in full
2. **For each MUST HAVE item**:
   - Check if requirement is met
   - If not met: report as violation with severity
   - If not applicable: verify explicit "N/A" with reasoning
3. **For each MUST NOT HAVE item**:
   - Scan document for violations
   - Report any findings

### Validation Report

Output format:
```
DESIGN Validation Report
════════════════════════

Structural: PASS/FAIL
Semantic: PASS/FAIL (N issues)

Issues:
- [SEVERITY] CHECKLIST-ID: Description
```

## Next Steps

After DESIGN generation/validation, offer these options:

| Condition | Suggested Next Step |
|-----------|---------------------|
| DESIGN complete | `/cypilot-generate DECOMPOSITION` — create specs manifest |
| Need architecture decision | `/cypilot-generate ADR` — document key decision |
| PRD missing/incomplete | `/cypilot-generate PRD` — create/update PRD first |
| DESIGN needs revision | Continue editing DESIGN |
| Want checklist review only | `/cypilot-analyze semantic` — semantic validation (skip deterministic) |
