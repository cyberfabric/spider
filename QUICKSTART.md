# FDD Quick Start

**Learn FDD in 10 minutes with real prompts and examples**
<!-- fdd-end   fdd-fdd-feature-core-methodology-flow-user-onboard:ph-1:inst-open-quickstart -->

---

## What You'll Learn

1. **Exact prompts to type** - Copy-paste into your AI chat
2. **Complete example** - Task management API from start to finish
3. **Common scenarios** - What to do when requirements change
4. **Working with existing docs** - Use what you already have

---

## The Basics

FDD = **Design First, Code Second**

```
1. Business Context
   ↓ (validated)
2. Overall Design
   ↓ (validated)
3. Features Manifest
   ↓ (validated)
4. Feature Design
   ↓ (validated)
5. Changes/Tasks
   ↓ (validated)
6. Implementation
   ↓ (validated)
7. Code
```

**Key principle**: If code contradicts design, fix design first, then regenerate code.

<!-- fdd-begin fdd-fdd-feature-core-methodology-flow-user-onboard:ph-1:inst-read-overview -->
## What is FDD?

**FDD (Feature-Driven Documentation)** is a methodology for architecting software through structured documentation.
<!-- fdd-end   fdd-fdd-feature-core-methodology-flow-user-onboard:ph-1:inst-read-overview -->

---

## Complete Example: Task Management API

Let's build a simple task management API step-by-step with actual prompts.

**Three scenarios covered in each step:**
1. 🆕 **New Project** - Starting from scratch
2. 📚 **Existing Project + Docs** - Have architecture docs, API specs, etc.
3. 💻 **Existing Project (Code Only)** - Have working code, no design docs

Choose the path that matches your situation.

### Step 1: Add FDD to Your Project (2 minutes)

**What it does**: Setup FDD Framework

**Option A: Git Project (recommended)**
```bash
# In your project root
git submodule add https://github.com/cyberfabric/fdd FDD
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

**Option B: Non-Git Project**
```bash
# Clone FDD into your project
cd your-project
git clone https://github.com/cyberfabric/fdd FDD
```

**Result**: `/FDD/` folder in your project root

---

### Step 2: Create Project AGENTS.md (1 minute, optional but recommended)

**What it does**: Links your project to FDD

**Create file** `AGENTS.md` in project root:
```markdown
# Project AI Agent Instructions

ALWAYS open and follow `/FDD/AGENTS.md`
```

**Result**: Root `AGENTS.md` created with FDD reference

---

### Step 3: Start with Business Context (15 minutes)

**What it does**: Describe what you're building (no tech details yet)

**Recommended model**: Thinking model (e.g., Claude Opus Thinking, Claude Sonnet Thinking)

Consider existing code structure
```

**What happens**:
- Agent runs `workflows/feature-changes.md`
- Reads `requirements/feature-changes-structure.md`
- Agent analyzes existing codebase
- Decomposes feature into changes that fit existing architecture
- May include refactoring tasks if needed
- **Creates artifact**: `architecture/features/feature-task-crud/CHANGES.md`

- Works same for all scenarios

**Result**: Feature complete ✅

---

### Step 13: Create or Update Project Adapter (optional, can run anytime)

**What it does**: Configure tech stack details for your project

**When to use**: Run this workflow anytime you need to define or update tech stack configuration. Not required for basic FDD workflows.

**Prompt to type**:
```
fdd create adapter
```

**What happens**:
- Agent runs `workflows/adapter.md`
- Creates `spec/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md` (minimal, with Extends only)
- Creates `specs/domain-model.md` and `specs/api-contracts.md` placeholders
- You configure tech stack details as needed
- **Creates artifact**: `spec/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md` and spec files

**Result**: `spec/FDD-Adapter/` folder with configuration

---

**Auto-Discovery Alternative**: For existing projects, use `adapter-auto`:

**Prompt**:
```
fdd auto-scan adapter
```

**What it does**:
- Agent runs `workflows/adapter-auto.md`
- Automatically scans your existing project:
  - Documentation (README, ARCHITECTURE, CONTRIBUTING)
  - ADRs (architecture decision records)
  - Config files (package.json, docker-compose.yml, etc.)
  - Code structure (frameworks, patterns, conventions)
  - API definitions (OpenAPI, GraphQL schemas)
  - Domain models (entities, schemas)
- Generates adapter specs from discovered patterns:
  - `specs/tech-stack.md` (detected technologies, frameworks, libraries)
  - `specs/domain-model.md` (extracted from code entities/schemas)
  - `specs/api-contracts.md` (from OpenAPI/GraphQL definitions)
  - `specs/patterns.md` (architectural patterns found)
  - `specs/conventions.md` (code style, naming conventions)
  - `specs/build-deploy.md` (CI/CD, deployment instructions)
  - `specs/testing.md` (test frameworks, strategies)

**When to use**: Perfect for existing projects with established codebase. Saves time by discovering tech stack automatically instead of manual configuration.

**Note**: This workflow can be executed at any point in your FDD process, whenever you need to formalize tech stack specifications.

## Get Help

**Validation failed?**
- Read error message carefully
- Check specific section mentioned
- Use FDL for flows (no code)
- Reference domain types from Overall Design

**Feature too large?**
- Break into multiple features
- Each feature = one capability
- Target ≤3000 lines per DESIGN.md

**Code contradicts design?**
- Fix design first
- Re-validate design
- Then regenerate code

**Need to change Overall Design?**
- Update DESIGN.md
- Re-validate with design-validate.md
- Update affected features
- Re-validate features

---

## Remember

✅ Design before code  
✅ Validate before implementing  
✅ Use FDL, not code in designs  
✅ Reference, don't redefine  
✅ Fix design first, code second
