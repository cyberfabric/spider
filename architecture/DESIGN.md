# Technical Design: FDD

## A. Architecture Overview

### Architectural Vision

FDD (Feature-Driven Design) employs a **layered architecture with plugin-based extensibility** to provide a technology-agnostic methodology framework. The core methodology layer defines universal workflows and validation rules, while the adapter layer enables project-specific customization without modifying core specifications. This separation ensures that FDD remains compatible with any technology stack while maintaining consistent design and validation patterns across all projects.

The architecture follows a **design-first approach** where artifacts are created and validated before implementation proceeds. Each layer builds upon validated artifacts from the previous layer, creating a traceable chain from business requirements through design to implementation. The validation layer uses a **deterministic gate pattern** where automated validators catch structural issues before expensive manual review, ensuring quality while maximizing efficiency.

AI agent integration is achieved through machine-readable specifications (AGENTS.md navigation, workflow files, structure requirements) and a skills-based tooling system. The WHEN clause pattern in AGENTS.md files creates a discoverable navigation system where AI agents can autonomously determine which specifications to follow based on the current workflow context.

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
### B.3: Design Principles

#### Principle 1: Technology Agnostic Core

**ID**: `fdd-fdd-principle-tech-agnostic`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `fdd-fdd-adr-initial-architecture-v1`

The core methodology MUST have zero technology dependencies. All technology choices MUST be in adapters, not core. The core MUST work equally well for Python, Rust, JavaScript, Java, Go, or any language. Domain model formats, API contract formats, and testing frameworks MUST be configurable per project. This principle ensures FDD remains universally applicable across all technology ecosystems.

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
#### Principle 2: Design Before Code

**ID**: `fdd-fdd-principle-design-first`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `fdd-fdd-adr-initial-architecture-v1`

All artifacts MUST be validated before implementation proceeds. Design is the single source of truth; code follows design specifications. Validation gates MUST prevent proceeding to next phase without passing quality threshold. This principle ensures thoughtful architecture and reduces technical debt by catching design issues before they become code issues.

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
#### Principle 3: Machine-Readable Specifications

**ID**: `fdd-fdd-principle-machine-readable`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `fdd-fdd-adr-initial-architecture-v1`

Domain models MUST be in parseable formats (not plain text descriptions). API contracts MUST be in machine-readable formats for validation and code generation. Workflow specifications MUST be structured for AI agent consumption. ID formats MUST be regular expressions for deterministic validation. This principle enables automation, reduces manual effort, and ensures consistency.

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
#### Principle 4: Progressive Validation

**ID**: `fdd-fdd-principle-deterministic-gate`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `fdd-fdd-adr-initial-architecture-v1`

Deterministic validators MUST run before manual review (Deterministic Gate pattern). Validators MUST fail fast on structural errors to save time. Manual validation MUST focus on design quality, not format checking. Validation layers (deterministic → manual → peer review) MUST be sequential. This principle maximizes efficiency by catching obvious errors immediately and reserving human attention for complex design decisions.

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
#### Principle 5: Traceability By Design

**ID**: `fdd-fdd-principle-traceability`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
**ADRs**: `fdd-fdd-adr-initial-architecture-v1`

Every design element MUST have a unique ID assigned at creation. Code tags (@fdd-*) MUST link implementation to specifications. Qualified IDs (base:ph-N:inst-name) MUST enable granular traceability. Repository-wide scanning MUST verify design-code mapping. This principle maintains design-code coherence and enables impact analysis when designs change.

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
### B.4: Constraints

#### Constraint 1: Python Standard Library Only

**ID**: `fdd-fdd-constraint-stdlib-only`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
The `fdd` validation tool MUST use only Python 3.6+ standard library. No external dependencies (pip packages) are permitted in core tooling. This constraint ensures FDD can run anywhere Python is available without complex installation or dependency management. Adapters may use any dependencies for project-specific code generation.

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
#### Constraint 2: Markdown-Only Artifacts

**ID**: `fdd-fdd-constraint-markdown`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
All FDD artifacts (BUSINESS.md, DESIGN.md, ADR.md, FEATURES.md, etc.) MUST be plain Markdown. No binary formats, proprietary tools, or custom file formats permitted. This constraint ensures artifacts are version-controllable, diffable, and editable in any text editor. Domain models and API contracts referenced by artifacts may be in any format (specified by adapter).

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
#### Constraint 3: Git-Based Workflow

**ID**: `fdd-fdd-constraint-git`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
FDD assumes Git version control for artifact history and collaboration. Change tracking relies on Git commits and diffs. Feature branches and pull requests are the collaboration model. This constraint aligns FDD with modern development practices but requires Git knowledge from users.

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
#### Constraint 4: No Forced Tool Dependencies

**ID**: `fdd-fdd-constraint-no-forced-tools`

<!-- fdd-id-content -->
FDD core MUST NOT require specific IDEs, editors, or development tools. Validation MUST run from command line without GUI tools. IDE integrations are optional enhancements, not requirements. This constraint ensures FDD works in any development environment (local, remote, CI/CD, etc.).

```

**Component Descriptions**:

**1. Methodology Core**
- Contains universal FDD specifications (requirements files, workflow files, core AGENTS.md)
- Defines artifact structure requirements (*-structure.md)
- Provides workflow templates (workflows/*.md)
- Technology-agnostic and stable across all projects
- Location: `FDD/` directory (requirements/, workflows/, AGENTS.md)

**2. Adapter System**
- Project-specific customization layer
- Adapter AGENTS.md extends core AGENTS.md via **Extends** mechanism
- Spec files define tech stack, domain model format, API contracts, conventions
- Auto-detection capability for existing codebases
 - Location: `<project>/.adapter/` or configured path

**3. ID Management**
- Generates and validates unique IDs for all design elements
  - Format: `fdd-<project>-<kind>-<name>` (lowercase kebab-case)
  - IDs MAY be versioned by appending a `-vN` suffix
  - When an identifier is replaced (REPLACE), the new identifier version MUST be incremented and all references MUST be updated (artifacts + code tags)
  - Supports qualified IDs for implementation tracking (:ph-N:inst-name)
  - Provides repository-wide scanning (scan-ids, where-defined, where-used)
  - Validates cross-references between artifacts

**4. Validation Engine**
- Deterministic validators for structural checking (fdd tool)
- 100-point scoring system with category breakdown
- Pass thresholds: ≥90/100 for most artifacts, 100/100 for feature designs
- Checks: required sections, ID formats, cross-references, placeholders
- Code traceability validation (@fdd-* tags in code)
- Implemented in: `skills/fdd/scripts/fdd.py`

**5. Workflow Engine**
- Operation workflows: Interactive artifact creation/update
- Validation workflows: Automated quality checks
- FDL processing: Plain-English algorithms with instruction markers
- Question-answer flow with context-based proposals
- Execution protocol: Prerequisites check → Specification reading → Interactive input → Content generation → Validation

**6. AI Integration Layer**
- AGENTS.md navigation: WHEN clause rules determine which specs to follow
- Skills system: Claude-compatible tools (fdd skill, future extensions)
- Deterministic gate pattern: Automated validators run before manual review
- Machine-readable specifications enable autonomous execution
- Structured prompts guide AI interactions

**Component Interactions**:

1. **AI Agent → Workflow Engine**: AGENTS.md navigation determines workflow to execute
2. **Workflow Engine → Adapter System**: Reads adapter specs for project conventions
3. **Workflow Engine → ID Management**: Generates IDs for new design elements
4. **Workflow Engine → Validation Engine**: Runs validators after artifact creation
5. **Validation Engine → ID Management**: Validates ID formats and cross-references
6. **Validation Engine → Methodology Core**: Uses requirements files as validation rules
7. **All Components → Methodology Core**: Reference requirements for specifications

### C.2: Domain Model

**Technology**: Markdown-based artifacts (not code-level types)

**Location**: 
- Artifact structure: `requirements/*-structure.md`
- ID format specification: `.adapter/specs/domain-model.md`
- Artifact examples: `architecture/BUSINESS.md`, workflow files

**Core Entities**:

**Artifacts**:
- `BUSINESS.md` (business context): Vision, Actors, Capabilities, Use Cases
- `DESIGN.md` (overall design): Architecture, Requirements, Technical Details
- `ADR.md` (architecture decisions): MADR-formatted decision records
- `FEATURES.md` (feature manifest): Feature list with status tracking
- `DESIGN.md` (feature scope): Feature specifications with flows, algorithms, states
- `CHANGES.md` (implementation plan): Atomic changes with task breakdown
- `architecture/changes/` (proposal space): Proposed changes, reviews, and archived proposals

**IDs**:
- Actor ID: `fdd-<project>-actor-<name>`
- Capability ID: `fdd-<project>-capability-<name>`
- Use Case ID: `fdd-<project>-usecase-<name>`
- Requirement ID: `fdd-<project>-req-<name>`
- Feature ID: `fdd-<project>-feature-<name>`
- Flow ID: `fdd-<project>-feature-<feature>-flow-<name>`
- Algorithm ID: `fdd-<project>-feature-<feature>-algo-<name>`
- State ID: `fdd-<project>-feature-<feature>-state-<name>`
- ADR ID: `ADR-<NNNN>` or `fdd-<project>-adr-<name>`

 All IDs MAY be versioned by appending a `-vN` suffix.

**Workflows**:
- Operation workflow (Type: Operation): Interactive artifact creation/update
- Validation workflow (Type: Validation): Automated quality checks

**Relationships**:
- BUSINESS.md defines Actors and Capabilities
- DESIGN.md references Actors/Capabilities, defines Requirements
- FEATURES.md references Requirements, lists Features
- Feature DESIGN.md references Actors, defines Flows/Algorithms/States
- CHANGES.md references Requirements from feature DESIGN.md
- ADR.md referenced by Requirements/Principles/Constraints

**Proposal Format (Deterministic Changeset v1)**:
- Proposals MUST live under `architecture/changes/` and MUST be machine-parseable
- Proposals MUST define ordered operations (ADD, UPDATE, REMOVE)
- Operations MUST target artifacts by path (e.g., `architecture/BUSINESS.md`) and MUST select targets by stable identifiers
- Selectors MUST prefer stable IDs (e.g., `fdd-fdd-capability-change-management`) over positional matching
- Each operation MUST include deterministic conflict detection (e.g., expected-before hash for the selected target)
- Merge MUST be deterministic and MUST produce the same output given the same approved state and proposal
- After merge, proposals MUST be archived for audit and traceability

**CRITICAL**: Domain model is Markdown-based artifact structure, not programming language types. Validation checks structure against requirements files, not type compilation.

### C.3: API Contracts

**Technology**: CLISPEC for command-line interface (fdd tool)

**Location**: 
- Format specification: `CLISPEC.md`
- Command specification: `skills/fdd/fdd.clispec`
- Implementation: `skills/fdd/scripts/fdd.py`

**Endpoints Overview**:

**Validation Commands**:
- `validate --artifact <path>`: Validate artifact structure
- `validate --artifact <code-root>`: Code traceability scan
- `validate --artifact <path>` MUST support validating proposal artifacts under `architecture/changes/` (changesets)

**Search Commands**:
- `list-sections --artifact <path>`: List document headings
- `list-ids --artifact <path>`: List all IDs
- `list-items --artifact <path>`: List typed items (actors, capabilities, etc.)
- `read-section --artifact <path> --section <A|B|C>`: Read section content
- `get-item --artifact <path> --id <id>`: Get specific item
- `find-id --artifact <path> --id <id>`: Find ID location
- `search --artifact <path> --query <text>`: Text search

**Traceability Commands**:
- `scan-ids --root <path>`: Scan all IDs in directory
- `where-defined --root <path> --id <id>`: Find normative definition
- `where-used --root <path> --id <id>`: Find all usages

**Adapter Discovery**:
- `adapter-info --root <path>`: Discover adapter configuration

**CRITICAL**: API contracts are CLISPEC format (command-line interface specification), not REST/HTTP. All commands output JSON for machine consumption.

### C.4: Security Model

**Authentication**: None (local command-line tool)

**Authorization**: File system permissions only

**Data Protection**: 
- No sensitive data collection or transmission
- All processing is local to developer machine
- No network requests or external API calls
- Git history contains all changes (audit trail)

**Security Boundaries**:
- Tool runs with user's file system permissions
- No privilege escalation required
- Read-only operations for search/traceability commands
- Write operations only for validation (report generation)
- Workflows create files only after user confirmation

**Note**: FDD is a methodology framework for design documentation, not a security-critical system. Security considerations are minimal as all operations are local and user-controlled.

### C.5: Non-Functional Requirements

See Section B.2 for complete NFR specifications:
- **NFR-001: Performance** - Validation speed, scanning performance
- **NFR-002: Compatibility** - Language/framework agnostic
- **NFR-003: Usability** - AI agent success rate, onboarding time
- **NFR-004: Maintainability** - Update compatibility, migration paths
- **NFR-005: Extensibility** - Incremental adoption, adapter system

## D. Additional Context

### Technology Selection Rationale

**Python 3 Standard Library Only**: Chosen for maximum portability and zero installation complexity. Python 3.6+ is available on most development machines. Standard library ensures no dependency management or version conflicts.

**Markdown for Artifacts**: Universal format compatible with all editors, version control systems, and documentation platforms. Plain text ensures longevity and accessibility. Syntax highlighting and rendering available in all modern development tools.

**CLISPEC for API**: Command-line interface is most compatible with CI/CD pipelines, remote development, and automation scripts. JSON output enables machine consumption and integration with other tools.

**GTS for FDD's Own Domain Model**: While FDD supports any domain model format via adapters, FDD itself uses GTS (Global Type System) for domain type definitions as a demonstration of machine-readable specifications.

### Implementation Considerations

**Incremental Adoption Path**:
1. Start with adapter (minimal: just Extends line)
2. Add BUSINESS.md (business context)
3. Add DESIGN.md (architecture)
4. Optionally add ADR.md (decisions)
5. Add FEATURES.md and feature designs
6. Add CHANGES.md and implement
7. Evolve adapter as patterns emerge

**Migration from Existing Projects**:
- Use `adapter-from-sources` workflow to auto-detect tech stack
- Reverse-engineer BUSINESS.md from existing requirements/PRD
- Extract DESIGN.md patterns from code structure and documentation
- Add traceability incrementally (new code first, legacy later)

**AI Agent Best Practices**:
- Always run `fdd adapter-info` before starting any workflow
- Use deterministic gate (fdd validate) before manual validation
- Follow execution-protocol.md for all workflow executions
- Use fdd skill for artifact search and ID lookup
- Never skip prerequisites validation

### Future Technical Improvements

**Performance Optimizations**:
- Caching for repository-wide ID scans (currently re-scans on each query)
- Incremental validation (only validate changed sections)
- Parallel processing for multi-artifact validation

**Enhanced Traceability**:
- Visual traceability graphs (actor → capability → requirement → code)
- Impact analysis UI (show all affected artifacts when changing design)
- Coverage metrics dashboard (% of requirements implemented, tested)

**IDE Integration Enhancements**:
- Language server protocol (LSP) for real-time validation
- Quick fixes for common validation errors
- Hover tooltips showing ID definitions
- Auto-completion for FDD IDs and references

**Adapter Ecosystem**:
- Public adapter registry for common tech stacks
- Adapter composition (extend multiple adapters)
- Adapter versioning and compatibility checking
- Community-contributed patterns and templates
