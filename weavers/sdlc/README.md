# SDLC Pipeline

## Overview

**Spaider SDLC** is an artifact-first pipeline that turns intent into implementation through a fixed sequence of document layers, with deterministic validation gates and end-to-end traceability.

- **Layered transformation**: PRD → ADR + DESIGN → DECOMPOSITION → SPEC → CODE.
- **Deterministic gates**: templates, IDs, cross-references, and task/acceptance criteria are validated at every step.
- **Behavior spec**: the **SPEC** layer expresses behavior as **Spaider DSL (SDSL)** flows/algorithms that can be implemented directly.
- **Traceability chain**: each downstream artifact references upstream IDs, and code keeps links via tags/markers.

## Pipeline Diagram

![**Spaider** SDLC pipeline: PRD → DESIGN → DECOMPOSITION → SPEC → CODE, with validation gates and ID traceability between layers](pipeline.drawio.svg)

Each layer **transforms** the previous artifact into a new form while **preserving traceability through IDs and references**:

| From | To | Transformation |
|------|-----|----------------|
| **PRD** | ADR + DESIGN | WHAT → HOW (architecture decisions and design) |
| **DESIGN** | DECOMPOSITION | Architecture → decomposition to specs |
| **DECOMPOSITION** | SPEC | Specs → detailed specification and definitions of done |
| **SPEC** | CODE | Detailed specification → implementation, source code |

The LLM reads the upstream artifact, understands its intent, and generates a downstream artifact of a **different kind** with explicit ID references back to the source. This creates a **traceable chain** from requirements to implementation.

## The 6-Layer SDLC Pipeline

| Artifact | Generation | Deterministic Validation | Feedback | Acceptance |
|----------|------------|--------------------------|----------|------------|
| **PRD** | Drafted from stakeholder input + market context with required IDs | Template structure, ID format | Semantic review vs industry best practices | Product Managers & Architects alignment |
| **ADR** | Captures key architecture decisions with rationale | Template structure, ID format | Semantic review vs industry best practices | Architects alignment |
| **DESIGN** | Derived from PRD with architecture decisions | Cross reference ID and tasks validation | Semantic review vs PRD + ADR + industry best practices | Architects alignment |
| **DECOMPOSITION** | Decomposed from DESIGN into implementable spec scope | Cross reference ID and tasks validation | Semantic review vs DESIGN + industry best practices | Architects alignment |
| **SPEC** | Expanded from DECOMPOSITION into **Spaider DSL** (**SDSL**) flows/algorithms plus implementation requirements | Cross reference ID and tasks validation | Semantic review vs DESIGN + DECOMPOSITION + industry best practices | Architects & Developers alignment |
| **CODE** | Implemented from SPEC specs with traceability in code comments | Cross reference ID and tasks validation | Semantic review vs SPEC + DESIGN + DECOMPOSITION + industry best practices | Developers & QA alignment |

## What SDLC weaver provides

**Structured Templates** — Templates in spaider format for each artifact kind.

**Semantic Checklists** — Expert review criteria for quality gates for each kind of artifact and source code. Agents self-review before output.

**Examples** — Canonical examples for each artifact kind.

**Rules specifications** — A set of tasks and acceptance criteria applicable for Spaider workflows to generate and validate each artifact kind and source code.
