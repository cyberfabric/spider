# Spaider vs OpenSpec vs Spec Kit vs MCAF vs BMAD vs Ralph

## Scope and framing
This comparison focuses on how each framework/toolkit structures work for AI-assisted software development:
- How you express intent (requirements/specs)
- How you plan and execute implementation
- What validation gates exist
- How traceability and documentation are handled

## One-paragraph summaries

### Spaider (Spec-Driven Design)
A design-first methodology with a layered artifact hierarchy (adapter → PRD → DESIGN (+ ADR) → DECOMPOSITION → SPEC → code), strict artifact structure requirements (sections, IDs, cross-links), and deterministic validation gates with scoring. It emphasizes plain-English behavioral specs (Spaider DSL (SDSL)) and traceability from design to code.

### OpenSpec
A change-first, spec-driven workflow centered on explicit change folders and “delta specs” that patch a source-of-truth spec set. It is optimized for brownfield evolution and multi-spec updates by separating current truth (`{project-root}/openspec/specs/`) from proposals (`{project-root}/openspec/changes/`).

### Spec Kit
A spec-driven development toolkit that bootstraps a repo template and provides slash commands to generate a constitution, functional spec, technical plan, tasks, and then execute implementation through agent workflows (e.g., `/speckit.constitution` → `/speckit.specify` → `/speckit.plan` → `/speckit.tasks` → `/speckit.implement`). It is oriented around phase checkpoints and a “spec → plan → tasks → implement” pipeline.

### MCAF (managedcode/MCAF)
A process framework focused on predictability via repository-local context, verification gates (tests + static analysis as decision makers), and codified agent instructions in `AGENTS.md`. It is less about a fixed spec format and more about repository governance, testing discipline, and repeatable agent workflows.

### BMAD Method (BMAD-METHOD)
An AI-driven agile development framework built around guided workflows across four phases (analysis → planning → solutioning → implementation), specialized agent personas, and scale-adaptive tracks (Quick Flow vs BMad Method vs Enterprise). It generates and updates planning artifacts (PRD, architecture, epics/stories, sprint tracking) as workflow outputs and emphasizes one-story-at-a-time implementation.

### Ralph (loop agents)
A loop-based autonomy technique and tooling where an outer loop reruns an AI coding agent in fresh context until objective verification passes (tests/typecheck/build and/or an explicit completion signal). State lives on disk (specs/tasks/scratchpad), and quality gates act as “backpressure.” Orchestration can be minimal (a bash loop) or configurable via presets and specialized personas.

### Quantitative scoring analysis

**Scoring methodology:**
- ✅ **Native = 3 points** (full first-class support)
- ⚠️ **Supported = 1 point** (partial/possible support)
- ❌ **Out of scope = 0 points** (absence is not penalized)
- 🚀 **Emerging = 0.5 points** (planned/in development)

This is a simple linear weighting system for the matrix. "Out of scope" receives 0 (not negative) because frameworks intentionally specialize—absence of a spec is not a deficiency if it's outside the framework's design goals.

**Scoring results:**

| Framework | Native (×3) | Supported (×1) | Out of scope (×0) | Emerging (×0.5) | **Total Score** |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Spaider** | 17 × 3 = 51 | 4 × 1 = 4 | 7 × 0 = 0 | 0 × 0.5 = 0 | **55** |
| **BMAD** | 12 × 3 = 36 | 6 × 1 = 6 | 10 × 0 = 0 | 0 × 0.5 = 0 | **42** |
| **MCAF** | 8 × 3 = 24 | 10 × 1 = 10 | 10 × 0 = 0 | 0 × 0.5 = 0 | **34** |
| **OpenSpec** | 6 × 3 = 18 | 10 × 1 = 10 | 11 × 0 = 0 | 1 × 0.5 = 0.5 | **28.5** |
| **Spec Kit** | 3 × 3 = 9 | 14 × 1 = 14 | 11 × 0 = 0 | 0 × 0.5 = 0 | **23** |
| **Ralph** | 3 × 3 = 9 | 12 × 1 = 12 | 13 × 0 = 0 | 0 × 0.5 = 0 | **21** |

**Key insights:**

1. **Spaider leads in total capability coverage** (55 points), particularly excelling in structured documentation, cross-artifact integrity, and multi-layer traceability.

2. **BMAD stands out for workflow execution capabilities** (42 points), primarily due to progressive disclosure, continuable workflows, and tri-modal create/validate/edit patterns.

3. **OpenSpec and MCAF cluster in the middle** (~28–34 points), but with different specializations:
   - OpenSpec: Change management and delta tracking
   - MCAF: Verification gates and testing discipline

4. **Spec Kit has broad "Supported" coverage** (14 capabilities) but fewer "Native" specs (3), indicating a generalist approach with lighter enforcement.

5. **Ralph scores lower on artifact/validator breadth** (21 points) because it is primarily an autonomy/loop technique; its strongest “native” specs are verification gates, fresh-context loops, and iteration/stop conditions.

6. **Specialization vs. breadth trade-off:**
   - Spaider: Deep native support for design-first methodology
   - OpenSpec: Deep native support for change-first workflow
   - MCAF: Deep native support for verification-first process
   - Spec Kit: Broad support across many areas with lighter enforcement
   - BMAD: Deep native support for workflow-driven planning and execution
   - Ralph: Deep native support for fresh-context iteration and verification loops

7. **No framework scores on "Tech stack dependency"** (informational row, not a capability).

## Deep comparison (dimensions)

### 1) “Center of gravity”
- **Spaider**: Design hierarchy + traceability (prd → architecture → spec decomposition → specs manifest → spec designs → code).
- **OpenSpec**: Change proposal + delta spec + archiving into living specs.
- **Spec Kit**: Spec-driven pipeline with a constitution + artifacts generated via slash commands (constitution → spec → plan → tasks → implement).
- **MCAF**: Predictability via shared repo context + tests/analyzers as gates + explicit agent instructions.
- **BMAD**: Workflow-driven agile planning + story-centric execution across phases (analysis → planning → solutioning → implementation).
- **Ralph**: Fresh-context iteration loops with verification/backpressure (repeat until objective completion criteria pass).

### 2) Artifact model and where truth lives
- **Spaider**
  - Truth is captured in a layered architecture of Markdown artifacts.
  - Strong separation of concerns: PRD vs architecture vs spec designs vs implementation plans.
  - Living evolution: implementation planning and status live in spec `DESIGN.md` and are updated iteratively during implementation.
- **OpenSpec**
  - Truth lives in `openspec/specs/`.
  - Proposals and deltas live in `openspec/changes/<change-id>/` and are later archived/merged into specs.
  - Living evolution: `archive` is the explicit mechanism for folding approved deltas back into the source-of-truth specs.
- **Spec Kit**
  - Truth is in generated spec/plan/task documents under a spec spec directory; the constitution constrains downstream work.
  - Living evolution: specs live in `specs/<nnn-spec>/...` and naturally evolve via a branch/PR lifecycle.
- **MCAF**
  - Truth is in the repository as a whole: code + docs + tests + instructions; tests/analyzers arbitrate correctness.
  - Living evolution: documentation is updated to reflect actual behavior; “truth” is proven by tests and analyzers.
- **BMAD**
  - Truth is distributed across workflow outputs (planning docs + story tracking) that are regenerated/updated by running workflows.
  - Living evolution: outputs evolve via reruns; progress is tracked via story/sprint status artifacts.
- **Ralph**
  - Truth is “whatever passes verification”: the loop writes state to disk, runs gates (tests/build/typecheck), and continues until verified complete.
  - Living evolution: PRD/tasks/progress logs on disk are updated each iteration; git commits become durable memory.

### 3) Validation gates and failure modes
- **Spaider**: Explicit validation chain per layer; dependent artifacts require validated parents.
- **OpenSpec**: Validate change folder (strict) and keep work proposal-first; archive after deployment.
- **Spec Kit**: Workflow emphasizes not moving to next phase until validated, but enforcement is primarily via process discipline + templates.
- **MCAF**: Spec docs and ADR are updated when needed; failing tests (including integration/API/UI) and analyzers block completion.
- **BMAD**: Workflow prerequisites and phase sequencing act as gates; Quick Flow emphasizes auto-validation of readiness; failures typically route back to earlier planning/workflow steps.
- **Ralph**: Gates are the loop stop condition: if tests/typecheck/build fail (or `verifyCompletion` returns false), the loop continues.

### 3.5) Types of determinism (what is “validated”)
- **Spaider**: Deterministic validators for doc/schema, cross-artifact references, and code traceability via `@spaider-*` markers.
- **OpenSpec**: Deterministic validator for change folder structure and spec/delta format; `archive` is the gate back into living specs.
- **Spec Kit**: Deterministic setup tooling plus template constraints; validation is primarily agent/human-driven (analysis/checklists) rather than a strict spec validator.
- **MCAF**: Deterministic executable gates (tests + static analysis) are the decision makers.
- **BMAD**: Determinism is primarily workflow-structure-driven (progressive disclosure, step sequencing, continuable workflows, tri-modal create/validate/edit) rather than a strict deterministic validator across a layered doc stack.
- **Ralph**: Determinism is primarily executable-gate-driven (tests/build/typecheck) with a fresh-context loop and explicit completion verification functions.

### 4) Traceability
- **Spaider**: First-class traceability from design IDs to code via tags and validation tooling, down to instruction-level granularity.
- **OpenSpec**: Traceability is “change-centric”: proposals/tasks/deltas are co-located per change.
- **Spec Kit**: Traceability is “spec pipeline-centric”: spec → plan → tasks → implement.
- **MCAF**: Traceability is “repo-centric”: docs link to tests and code; instructions standardize commands and workflow.
- **BMAD**: Traceability is “story-centric”: planning artifacts decompose into epics/stories which drive implementation.
- **Ralph**: Traceability is “verification-centric”: tasks map to commits and passing checks; progress is recorded on disk and reflected in git history.

### 5) Best-fit use cases
- **Spaider** fits best when you need:
  - Business-reviewable behavior specs (plain English), strong layered documentation, and design→code traceability.
  - Multi-spec systems where cross-spec consistency matters.
- **OpenSpec** fits best when you need:
  - Clear audit trail of changes, explicit deltas, and a workflow optimized for evolving existing behavior across multiple specs.
- **Spec Kit** fits best when you want:
  - A bootstrap template + a guided pipeline that turns “what/why” into plan and tasks and then drives implementation.
- **MCAF** fits best when you need:
  - Strong engineering hygiene: verification gates, disciplined AGENTS.md governance, and repo-local “single shared context.”
- **BMAD** fits best when you want:
  - A guided end-to-end agile workflow that produces planning artifacts (PRD, architecture, epics/stories) and supports story-based implementation loops.
- **Ralph** fits best when you want:
  - An autonomy “engine” that iterates until verified complete, especially in repos where tests/typecheck/build are reliable signals.

### 6) Artifact strictness and integrity controls
- **Spaider**: Treats artifacts as a schema-driven system: each artifact has a required structure (section order/naming), strict ID formats, payload blocks, and cross-artifact reference rules; validation is designed to detect missing sections, broken links, placeholder content, invalid IDs, and cross-layer inconsistencies.
- **OpenSpec**: Strictness is concentrated in the change proposal: you get a prescribed change folder layout and delta spec conventions with validation on the proposal itself; it is less focused on global cross-artifact integrity across a layered documentation stack.
- **Spec Kit**: Strictness is primarily constitutional/template-driven (process discipline), not enforced by a dedicated deterministic validator across documents.
- **MCAF**: Strictness is enforced via repository gates (tests/analyzers) and governance (instructions), rather than a required schema for architecture/spec artifacts.
- **BMAD**: Strictness is enforced through workflow standards for planning artifacts and step-by-step execution patterns (including create/validate/edit modes), but it is less focused on deterministic cross-artifact integrity checks across a layered doc stack.
- **Ralph**: Strictness is enforced through passing gates and small tasks; document structure and artifact schemas are repo-dependent.

### 7) Where Spaider is unusually strong
- Layered artifacts are backed by explicit structure requirements and an execution protocol (workflows and requirements are first-class).
- Workflows themselves are structured specs (prerequisites, ordered steps, validation criteria/checklists), which reduces ambiguity for AI agents.
- Deterministic tooling is not only format checking: it includes cascading dependency validation and cross-artifact integrity checks.
- Traceability is explicit and can be made instruction-level (phases + instruction IDs), enabling design→code auditability.
- Scoring/threshold gates encourage consistent quality and make “done” more objective.

## Practical interoperability patterns

### Pattern A: Spaider + OpenSpec (layered design + delta change tracking)
- Use **Spaider** for layered artifacts and spec decomposition.
- Use **OpenSpec** for change proposals/deltas when you need an external-facing audit trail, or when multiple specs must be patched in a controlled way.

### Pattern B: Spec Kit for bootstrap, then migrate to Spaider-style layering
- Use Spec Kit templates and constitution to generate initial spec/plan/tasks.
- When the system grows, adopt a layered approach (e.g., separate PRD, global design, and per-spec designs).

### Pattern C: MCAF verification doctrine applied to any of the above
- Regardless of spec system, apply MCAF’s “tests + analyzers are decision makers” and strict instructions governance.

### Pattern D: BMAD for planning and artifact generation, then Spaider/OpenSpec for long-lived specs
- Use **BMAD** to generate planning artifacts and maintain story-level execution flow.
- Use **Spaider** (layered design + deterministic validation) and/or **OpenSpec** (delta change proposals) when you need long-lived, auditable specs with stronger format/validator guarantees.

### Pattern E: Ralph as an implementation loop for any methodology
- Use **Ralph** to execute small, verifiable work units in a loop until tests/typecheck/build pass.
- Pair with **Spaider/OpenSpec/Spec Kit/BMAD** for planning/spec artifacts; treat Ralph as the “executor.”
