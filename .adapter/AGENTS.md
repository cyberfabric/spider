## ⚠️ SCOPE LIMITATION ⚠️

**MUST SKIP this file** UNLESS working on FDD framework development

**MUST IGNORE this adapter** WHEN using FDD for other projects

**ONLY FOLLOW this adapter** WHEN developing or modifying the FDD framework itself

This adapter is for FDD project development, not for projects using FDD.

- [ ] Workspace root contains `AGENTS.md`, `FDL.md`, `workflows/`, `requirements/` directories
- [ ] Workspace root contains `.fdd-config.json` with `"project": "FDD"` or repository name is "FDD"
- [ ] Task involves modifying FDD core files (`workflows/`, `requirements/`, `AGENTS.md`, `FDL.md`)
- [ ] Task is NOT about using FDD in another project
- [ ] No parent directory contains another project's `.fdd-config.json` or project files
- [ ] User explicitly mentioned "FDD framework development" or "modifying FDD itself"
