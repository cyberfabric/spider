# FDD vs OpenSpec vs Spec Kit vs MCAF

## Scope and framing
This comparison focuses on how each framework/toolkit structures work for AI-assisted software development:
- How you express intent (requirements/specs)
- How you plan and execute implementation
- What validation gates exist
- How traceability, change management, and documentation are handled

## One-paragraph summaries

### FDD (Feature-Driven Design)
A design-first methodology with a layered artifact hierarchy (adapter → business context → overall design → features manifest → feature design → changes → code), strict artifact structure requirements (sections, IDs, cross-links), and deterministic validation gates with scoring. It emphasizes plain-English behavioral specs (FDL) and traceability from design to code.

### OpenSpec
A change-first, spec-driven workflow centered on explicit change folders and “delta specs” that patch a source-of-truth spec set. It is optimized for brownfield evolution and multi-spec updates by separating current truth (`openspec/specs/`) from proposals (`openspec/changes/`).

### Spec Kit
A spec-driven development toolkit that bootstraps a repo template and provides slash commands to generate a constitution, functional spec, technical plan, tasks, and then execute implementation through agent workflows (e.g., `/speckit.constitution` → `/speckit.specify` → `/speckit.plan` → `/speckit.tasks` → `/speckit.implement`). It is oriented around phase checkpoints and a “spec → plan → tasks → implement” pipeline.

### MCAF (managedcode/MCAF)
A process framework focused on predictability via repository-local context, verification gates (tests + static analysis as decision makers), and codified agent instructions in `AGENTS.md`. It is less about a fixed spec format and more about repository governance, testing discipline, and repeatable agent workflows.

### Quantitative scoring analysis

**Scoring methodology:**
- ✅ **Native = 3 points** (full first-class support)
- ⚠️ **Supported = 1 point** (partial/possible support)
- ❌ **Out of scope = 0 points** (absence is not penalized)
- 🚀 **Emerging = 0.5 points** (planned/in development)

This is an industry-standard linear weighting system for feature comparison matrices. "Out of scope" receives 0 (not negative) because frameworks intentionally specialize—absence of a feature is not a deficiency if it's outside the framework's design goals.

**Scoring results:**

| Framework | Native (×3) | Supported (×1) | Out of scope (×0) | Emerging (×0.5) | **Total Score** |
|-----------|-------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **FDD** | 15 × 3 = 45 | 6 × 1 = 6 | 6 × 0 = 0 | 0 × 0.5 = 0 | **51** |
| **OpenSpec** | 9 × 3 = 27 | 8 × 1 = 8 | 9 × 0 = 0 | 1 × 0.5 = 0.5 | **35.5** |
| **Spec Kit** | 4 × 3 = 12 | 13 × 1 = 13 | 10 × 0 = 0 | 0 × 0.5 = 0 | **25** |
| **MCAF** | 8 × 3 = 24 | 11 × 1 = 11 | 8 × 0 = 0 | 0 × 0.5 = 0 | **35** |

**Key insights:**

1. **FDD leads in total capability coverage** (51 points), particularly excelling in structured documentation, cross-artifact integrity, and multi-layer traceability.

2. **OpenSpec and MCAF are tied in practical terms** (~35 points each), but with different specializations:
   - OpenSpec: Change management and evolution tracking
   - MCAF: Testing discipline and verification gates

3. **Spec Kit has the broadest "Supported" coverage** (13 capabilities) but fewer "Native" features (4), indicating a generalist approach with less opinionated enforcement.

4. **Specialization vs. breadth trade-off:**
   - FDD: Deep native support for design-first methodology
   - OpenSpec: Deep native support for change-first workflow
   - MCAF: Deep native support for verification-first process
   - Spec Kit: Broad support across many areas with lighter enforcement

5. **No framework scores on "Tech stack dependency"** (informational row, not a capability).

**Important caveat:** This scoring reflects **capability breadth**, not **fitness for a specific use case**. A framework with a lower score may be the perfect choice for your specific needs. See "Best-fit use cases" section for guidance.

## Deep comparison (dimensions)

### 1) “Center of gravity”
- **FDD**: Design hierarchy + traceability (business → architecture → feature decomposition → features manifest → feature designs → changes → code).
- **OpenSpec**: Change proposal + delta spec + archiving into living specs.
- **Spec Kit**: Spec-driven pipeline with a constitution + artifacts generated via slash commands (constitution → spec → plan → tasks → implement).
- **MCAF**: Predictability via shared repo context + tests/analyzers as gates + explicit agent instructions.

### 2) Artifact model and where truth lives
- **FDD**
  - Truth is captured in a layered architecture of Markdown artifacts.
  - Strong separation of concerns: business context vs architecture vs feature designs vs implementation plans.
  - Living evolution: implementation planning captured in `CHANGES.md`; historical change plans archived per feature.
- **OpenSpec**
  - Truth lives in `openspec/specs/`.
  - Proposals and deltas live in `openspec/changes/<change-id>/` and are later archived/merged into specs.
  - Living evolution: `archive` is the explicit mechanism for folding approved deltas back into the source-of-truth specs.
- **Spec Kit**
  - Truth is in generated spec/plan/task documents under a feature spec directory; the constitution constrains downstream work.
  - Living evolution: specs live in `specs/<nnn-feature>/...` and naturally evolve via a branch/PR lifecycle.
- **MCAF**
  - Truth is in the repository as a whole: code + docs + tests + instructions; tests/analyzers arbitrate correctness.
  - Living evolution: documentation is updated to reflect actual behavior; “truth” is proven by tests and analyzers.

### 3) Validation gates and failure modes
- **FDD**: Explicit validation chain per layer; dependent artifacts require validated parents.
- **OpenSpec**: Validate change folder (strict) and do not implement before proposal is approved; archive after deployment.
- **Spec Kit**: Workflow emphasizes not moving to next phase until validated, but enforcement is primarily via process discipline + templates.
- **MCAF**: Feature docs and ADR are updated when needed; failing tests (including integration/API/UI) and analyzers block completion.

### 3.5) Types of determinism (what is “validated”)
- **FDD**: Deterministic validators for doc/schema, cross-artifact references, and code traceability via `@fdd-*` markers.
- **OpenSpec**: Deterministic validator for change folder structure and spec/delta format; `archive` is the gate back into living specs.
- **Spec Kit**: Deterministic setup tooling plus template constraints; validation is primarily agent/human-driven (analysis/checklists) rather than a strict spec validator.
- **MCAF**: Deterministic executable gates (tests + static analysis) are the decision makers.

### 4) Traceability
- **FDD**: First-class traceability from design IDs to code via tags and validation tooling, down to instruction-level granularity.
- **OpenSpec**: Traceability is “change-centric”: proposals/tasks/deltas are co-located per change.
- **Spec Kit**: Traceability is “spec pipeline-centric”: spec → plan → tasks → implement.
- **MCAF**: Traceability is “repo-centric”: docs link to tests and code; instructions standardize commands and workflow.

### 5) Best-fit use cases
- **FDD** fits best when you need:
  - Business-reviewable behavior specs (plain English), strong layered documentation, and design→code traceability.
  - Multi-feature systems where cross-feature consistency matters.
- **OpenSpec** fits best when you need:
  - Clear audit trail of changes, explicit deltas, and a workflow optimized for evolving existing behavior across multiple specs.
- **Spec Kit** fits best when you want:
  - A bootstrap template + a guided pipeline that turns “what/why” into plan and tasks and then drives implementation.
- **MCAF** fits best when you need:
  - Strong engineering hygiene: verification gates, disciplined AGENTS.md governance, and repo-local “single shared context.”

### 6) Artifact strictness and integrity controls
- **FDD**: Treats artifacts as a schema-driven system: each artifact has a required structure (section order/naming), strict ID formats, payload blocks, and cross-artifact reference rules; validation is designed to detect missing sections, broken links, placeholder content, invalid IDs, and cross-layer inconsistencies.
- **OpenSpec**: Strictness is concentrated in the change proposal: you get a prescribed change folder layout and delta spec conventions with validation on the proposal itself; it is less focused on global cross-artifact integrity across a layered documentation stack.
- **Spec Kit**: Strictness is primarily constitutional/template-driven (process discipline), not enforced by a dedicated deterministic validator across documents.
- **MCAF**: Strictness is enforced via repository gates (tests/analyzers) and governance (instructions), rather than a required schema for architecture/spec artifacts.

### 7) Where FDD is unusually strong
- Layered artifacts are backed by explicit structure requirements and an execution protocol (workflows and requirements are first-class).
- Deterministic tooling is not only format checking: it includes cascading dependency validation and cross-artifact integrity checks.
- Traceability is explicit and can be made instruction-level (phases + instruction IDs), enabling design→code auditability.
- Scoring/threshold gates encourage consistent quality and make “done” more objective.

## Practical interoperability patterns

### Pattern A: FDD + OpenSpec (layered design + delta change tracking)
- Use **FDD** for layered artifacts and feature decomposition.
- Use **OpenSpec** for change proposals/deltas when you need an external-facing audit trail, or when multiple specs must be patched in a controlled way.

### Pattern B: Spec Kit for bootstrap, then migrate to FDD-style layering
- Use Spec Kit templates and constitution to generate initial spec/plan/tasks.
- When the system grows, adopt a layered approach (e.g., separate business context, global design, and per-feature designs).

### Pattern C: MCAF verification doctrine applied to any of the above
- Regardless of spec system, apply MCAF’s “tests + analyzers are decision makers” and strict instructions governance.
