# Validate Feature Design

**Type**: Validation  
**Role**: Solution Architect, Architect (control)  
**Artifact**: Validation report (output to chat)

---

## Requirements

**MUST read**: `../requirements/feature-design-structure.md`

Extract:
- Required sections structure
- FDL validation requirements
- Validation criteria (100 points breakdown)
- Pass threshold (100/100 + 100% completeness)

---

## Prerequisites

**MUST validate**:
- [ ] Feature DESIGN.md exists - validate: Check file at `architecture/features/feature-{slug}/DESIGN.md`
- [ ] DESIGN.md exists and validated
- [ ] FEATURES.md exists and validated

**If missing**: Run prerequisite workflows

---

## Steps

### 1. Read Dependencies

Open:
- `architecture/DESIGN.md` - Extract all types, requirements
- `architecture/features/FEATURES.md` - Extract feature requirements

### 2. Execute Validation

Follow validation criteria from `feature-design-structure.md`:
- Structure (20 pts)
- Completeness (30 pts)
- FDL Correctness (25 pts)
- Non-Contradiction (25 pts)

Calculate total score

### 3. Check Completeness

- No placeholders
- All sections present
- 100% completeness required

### 4. Output Results to Chat

**Format**:
```markdown
## Validation: Feature DESIGN.md ({feature-slug})

**Score**: {X}/100  
**Completeness**: {X}%  
**Status**: PASS | FAIL  
**Threshold**: 100/100 + 100%

---

### Findings

**Structure** ({X}/20):
✅ | ❌ {item}

**Completeness** ({X}/30):
✅ | ❌ {item}

**FDL Correctness** ({X}/25):
✅ | ❌ {item}

**Non-Contradiction** ({X}/25):
✅ | ❌ {item}

---

### Recommendations

**Critical** (must fix):
1. {Fix}

```

---

## Validation

Self-validating workflow

---

## Next Steps

**If PASS**: `feature-changes` workflow (create implementation plan)

**If FAIL**: Fix feature DESIGN.md issues, re-run `feature-validate`
