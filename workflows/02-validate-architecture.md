# Validate Overall Design

**Phase**: 1 - Architecture Design  
**Purpose**: Validate Overall Design (DESIGN.md) completeness and structure

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: This workflow is a validation wrapper. All validation criteria are defined in `../requirements/overall-design-structure.md`. Read that file first before proceeding.

### Step 1: Read Requirements File

**Action**: Read `../requirements/overall-design-structure.md` in full

**Purpose**: Load complete validation criteria including:
- File location and size requirements
- Required sections and subsections structure
- Content validation criteria for each section
- Validation scoring methodology
- Output format requirements

### Step 2: Validate Against Requirements

**Action**: Validate `architecture/DESIGN.md` against ALL criteria from requirements file

**Validation Process**:
1. Check file-level validation (existence, size)
2. Check structure validation (sections A-D, subsections C.1-C.5)
3. Check content validation (domain model, API contracts, completeness)
4. Calculate score according to requirements scoring system
5. Generate validation report in chat (not as file)

**Report Format** (from requirements):
- Score: X/100 (must be ≥90)
- Completeness: X% (must be 100%)
- Issues: List of missing/invalid items
- Recommendations: What to fix

### Step 3: Validate Project Structure

**Action**: Verify project structure created by workflow 01

**Required Directories** (from workflow 01 Requirement 1, 4, 5):
- ✅ `architecture/features/` exists
- ✅ `architecture/diagrams/` exists  
- ✅ Domain model directory exists (per adapter)
- ✅ API contract directory exists (per adapter)
- ✅ `openspec/` exists
- ✅ `openspec/specs/` exists
- ✅ `openspec/changes/` exists
- ✅ `openspec/changes/archive/` exists

**Required Files** (from workflow 01 Requirement 5):
- ✅ `openspec/project.md` exists

**If structure incomplete**:
- ❌ Report missing directories/files
- Recommend: Re-run workflow 01 or create missing structure manually

### Step 4: Determine Next Action

**If validation passes** (score ≥90, completeness 100%, structure complete):
- ✅ Suggest next workflow: `03-init-features.md` or `04-validate-features.md`

**If validation fails**:
- ❌ List specific issues from requirements that failed
- ❌ List missing project structure elements
- Provide actionable recommendations to fix
- User must fix issues and re-run validation

## End of Workflow

**Remember**: All validation logic is in `../requirements/overall-design-structure.md`. This workflow is just a thin wrapper that instructs you to read and apply those requirements.
