# PR Review Workflow

**Type**: Analysis
**Role**: Reviewer
**Output**: `.prs/{ID}/review.md`

---

## Routing

| User Intent | Route | Example |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Review a specific PR | **pr-review.md** | "review PR 123", `/cypilot-pr-review 123` |
| Review all open PRs | **pr-review.md** | "review all PRs", `/cypilot-pr-review ALL` |
| Check PR status | **pr-status.md** | "PR status 123", `/cypilot-pr-status ALL` |

---

## Overview

Accepts one argument: a PR number (e.g. `123`) or `ALL`.
Also triggered by natural-language prompts like `cypilot review PR 123`,
`review PR #59`, or `cypilot review PR https://github.com/org/repo/pull/123`.

All review is **read-only** — the LLM reads the downloaded diff file and
the current repo source without modifying the local working tree.

**IMPORTANT**: Every review request MUST re-fetch and re-analyze from scratch.
NEVER reuse data or analysis from a previous run in this conversation.
Previous results are stale the moment a new review request arrives.

---

## Paths

- **Script**: `python3 .cypilot/skills/scripts/pr.py`
- **Config**: `{cypilot_adapter_path}/pr-review.json`
- **Templates**: `.cypilot/templates/pr/`
- **Checklists**: `docs/checklists/` (PRD.md, DESIGN.md, ADR.md, etc.)
- **Prompts**: `.cypilot/prompts/pr/`
- **PR data**: `.prs/{ID}/`
- **Exclude list**: `.prs/config.yaml` → `exclude_prs`

## Prerequisites

- [ ] `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- [ ] Repository has GitHub remote configured
- [ ] `{cypilot_adapter_path}/pr-review.json` has `prompts` configured

## Steps

0. **List open PRs (when needed)**
   // turbo
   Run: `python3 .cypilot/skills/scripts/pr.py list`
   ALWAYS run this step WHEN target is `ALL` or no PR number was specified.
   Present the list to the user so they can select a PR or confirm ALL.
   This respects the `.prs/config.yaml` exclude list.
   **NEVER use `gh pr list` directly — ALWAYS use `pr.py list`.**

1. **Fetch PR data (MANDATORY — always re-fetch)**
   // turbo
   Run: `python3 .cypilot/skills/scripts/pr.py fetch <ARG>`
   This downloads the **latest** PR metadata, diff, and comments from
   GitHub into `.prs/{ID}/`. Fetch never uses cached data — it always
   overwrites any previously fetched files.
   **ALWAYS run this step, even if the same PR was fetched earlier in this conversation.**
   Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT reuse previously fetched data.

2. **Select review prompt and checklist**
   Read `{cypilot_adapter_path}/pr-review.json` → `prompts` list. For each prompt
   entry, read the `description` field. Based on the PR title, body (in
   `meta.json`), and the files changed (in `diff.patch`), select the most
   appropriate review prompt. If unsure, default to "Code Review".
   Load the corresponding `promptFile` and `checklist` from the matched entry.
   Use the checklist criteria to guide the review depth and structure.

3. **For each PR** (if ALL, iterate; otherwise single):

   a. **Understand scope of changes**
      Parse `.prs/{ID}/diff.patch` headers to get a list of affected files
      and lines added/removed per file. Use this to **focus the review on
      the files and areas actually changed by the PR**.

   b. **Analyze existing PR feedback**
      Read `.prs/{ID}/review_threads.json` and the `comments` array in
      `.prs/{ID}/meta.json`. For each reviewer comment or thread:
      - Note the concern raised and whether it is resolved or open.
      - Assess relevance: does the concern point to a real issue in the
        code, or is it a style nit / false positive?
      - Track which concerns were addressed (resolved threads with matching
        code changes) and which were dismissed without action.
      Use this analysis to inform the final verdict — if reviewers raised
      valid unresolved concerns, those should lower the confidence to
      approve. If all concerns are addressed, that supports approval.

   c. **Review the changes (read-only)**
      Read `.prs/{ID}/diff.patch` to understand what changed.
      For each affected file, open the **current version in the repo** and
      review it in context of the diff. This is the standard agentic IDE
      flow — no local modifications are made.
      Prioritise files with the largest delta first. Produce a thorough
      review covering the areas specified in the prompt and checklist.

   d. **Write review output**
      Read the template at `.cypilot/templates/pr/code-review.md` and
      use it to structure the review. Save the review to
      `.prs/{ID}/review.md`.
      The review must follow the template format, including the mandatory
      **"Reviewer Comment Analysis"** section. The final verdict must
      factor in unresolved valid concerns from reviewers.

4. **Present results**
   Summarize the review findings to the user, including:
   - Own findings from the code review.
   - Reviewer comment analysis: which concerns are valid, addressed, or
     still open.
   - Final verdict factoring in both own findings and reviewer feedback.
   If ALL, provide a brief summary per PR and note which PRs need the
   most attention.
