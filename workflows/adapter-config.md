# Create FDD Adapter

**Phase**: 0 - Pre-Project Setup  
**Purpose**: Create project-specific FDD adapter through guided questions

---

## Prerequisites

- FDD specification available somewhere in project
- Understanding of project technology stack
- Project root directory exists

**Note**: FDD specification location is auto-detected at workflow start

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL CHECKLIST - MUST COMPLETE ALL

This workflow creates **2 mandatory files**. You MUST create BOTH:

- [ ] **File 1**: FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md (core adapter config)
- [ ] **File 2**: FDD-Adapter/workflows/AGENTS.md (workflow extensions)

**STOP after creating files and verify both exist before finishing.**

**If you skip ANY file, workflow 01 will FAIL.**

---

## Overview

This workflow creates a minimal, focused FDD adapter based on user needs. The adapter extends FDD core methodology with project-specific conventions **without adding unnecessary complexity**.

**Key Principle**: Ask questions, create only what's requested, nothing more.

---

## Workflow Initialization

### Step 0: Detect FDD Specification Location

**Requirement**: Automatically determine FDD specification directory from workflow file location

**Detection Logic**:
1. This workflow file is located at: `{FDD_SPEC_PATH}/workflows/00-create-adapter.md`
2. Therefore `FDD_SPEC_PATH` = parent directory of `workflows/`
3. Calculate from workflow file location:
   - Workflow directory: `dirname(this_workflow_file)` → `{FDD_SPEC_PATH}/workflows/`
   - FDD spec directory: `dirname(workflow_directory)` → `{FDD_SPEC_PATH}`

**Example**:
- Workflow at: `spec/FDD/workflows/00-create-adapter.md`
- FDD spec at: `spec/FDD/`

**Store as**: `FDD_SPEC_PATH` (relative to project root)

**Expected Outcome**: FDD specification path calculated from workflow location

**Validation Criteria**:
- `{FDD_SPEC_PATH}/AGENTS.md` exists
- `{FDD_SPEC_PATH}/workflows/` exists (current directory)
- `{FDD_SPEC_PATH}/ADAPTER_GUIDE.md` exists

**If Validation Fails**:
```
❌ Error: FDD specification structure invalid.

Expected structure:
{FDD_SPEC_PATH}/
├── AGENTS.md
├── ADAPTER_GUIDE.md
├── FDL.md
└── workflows/
    └── 00-create-adapter.md (this file)

Current location: {FDD_SPEC_PATH}
```

**Display to User**:
```
✓ FDD specification: {FDD_SPEC_PATH}
```

---

## Interactive Questions

Ask the user these questions **one by one** to gather requirements:

### Q1: Project Name
```
What is your project name? (used for adapter directory name)
Example: "web-app", "mobile-api", "cli-tool"
```
**Store as**: `PROJECT_NAME`

### Q2: Domain Model Technology
```
What technology will you use for domain model?
Options:
  1. TypeScript interfaces
  2. JSON Schema
  3. GTS (Global Type System) + JSON Schema
  4. Protobuf
  5. GraphQL Schema
  6. Other (specify)
```
**Store as**: `DML_TECH`

**If user selects "GTS (Global Type System) + JSON Schema"**:
Display GTS-specific requirements:
```
⚠️  GTS Identifier Requirements

GTS identifiers MUST follow strict format rules:
- All segments must be LOWERCASE (a-z, 0-9, underscore)
- Format: gts.vendor.package.namespace.type.v<MAJOR>[.<MINOR>]
- Segments: lowercase letters, digits, underscores only
- Segments must start with letter or underscore (NOT digit)
- NO uppercase letters allowed (ValidationResult ❌, validation_result ✅)

Examples:
✅ CORRECT: gts.ainetx.myapp.users.user_profile.v1
✅ CORRECT: gts.acme.billing.payment.invoice_item.v2.1
❌ WRONG: gts.ainetx.myapp.users.UserProfile.v1
❌ WRONG: gts.ainetx.myapp.Users.Profile.v1

Reference: See spec/GTS/README.md for complete specification
```

**If user selects "Other"**, ask:
```
Please specify the domain model technology:
- Technology name: ___
- File location for schemas: ___
- Reference syntax for types (describe how to reference types in this technology): ___
```

**Then ask about specification**:
```
Does this technology have a specification document?
Options:
  1. Yes, specification exists in project (provide path)
  2. Yes, specification exists externally (provide URL)
  3. No, need to create specification
  4. Skip for now (adapter will be incomplete)
```

**Action based on answer**:

**Option 1 - Spec exists in project**:
- Ask: "Path to specification: ___"
- Validate path exists
- Store as: `DML_SPEC_PATH`

**Option 2 - Spec exists externally**:
- Ask: "URL to specification: ___"
- Ask: "Should we download/clone it to project? (y/n)"
- If yes: "Where to place it? (e.g., spec/{tech-name})"
- Store as: `DML_SPEC_URL` and optionally `DML_SPEC_PATH`

**Option 3 - Need to create**:
- Show message:
  ```
  ⚠️  Specification required for custom technology.
  
  Please create specification document:
  - Recommended location: spec/{tech-name}/
  - Should include:
    * Type system rules
    * Reference syntax
    * Validation rules
    * Examples
  
  After creating, provide path: ___
  ```
- Store as: `DML_SPEC_PATH`

**Option 4 - Skip**:
- Set `DML_SPEC_STATUS` = "INCOMPLETE"
- Show warning:
  ```
  ⚠️  Adapter will be created with INCOMPLETE status.
  
  ALL workflows will be BLOCKED until specification is provided.
  
  You can complete adapter later by:
  1. Adding specification to project
  2. Updating adapter AGENTS.md with spec path
  3. Setting status to COMPLETE
  ```

### Q3: Domain Model Location
```
Where will domain model files be located?
Options:

  3. gRPC (.proto)
  4. CLISPEC (for CLI tools)
  5. Custom format (specify)
  6. None (no API contracts needed)
```
**Store as**: `API_TECH`

**If user selects "CLISPEC"**:
- Set `API_SPEC_PATH` = `../FDD/CLISPEC.md` (relative path from adapter)
- Show message:
  ```
  ✓ CLISPEC selected
  
  CLISPEC is a simple, human and machine-readable format for CLI commands.
  Specification: spec/FDD/CLISPEC.md
  
  Your adapter will reference the built-in CLISPEC specification.
  CLI commands will be documented in: architecture/cli-specs/commands.clispec
  ```

**If user selects "Custom format"**, ask:
```
Please describe your custom API format:
- Format name: ___

- File extension: ___
- Brief description: ___
```

**Then ask about specification**:
```
Does this format have a specification document?
Options:
  1. Yes, specification exists in project (provide path)
  2. Yes, specification exists externally (provide URL)
  3. No, need to create specification
  4. Skip for now (adapter will be incomplete)
```

**Action based on answer**:

**Option 1 - Spec exists in project**:
- Ask: "Path to specification: ___"
- Validate path exists
- Store as: `API_SPEC_PATH`

**Option 2 - Spec exists externally**:

    * Format structure
    * Validation rules
    * Linking syntax
    * Examples
  
  After creating, provide path: ___
  ```
- Store as: `API_SPEC_PATH`

**Option 4 - Skip**:
- Set `API_SPEC_STATUS` = "INCOMPLETE"
- Show warning:
  ```
  ⚠️  Adapter will be created with INCOMPLETE status.
  
  ALL workflows will be BLOCKED until specification is provided.
  
  You can complete adapter later by:
  1. Adding specification to project
  2. Updating adapter AGENTS.md with spec path
  3. Setting status to COMPLETE
  ```

### Q5: API Contract Location
```
Where will API contract files be located?

**If INCOMPLETE**:
- Add warning comment in `AGENTS.md` header
- Document missing specifications
- Provide instructions for completion

---

**Interactive Mode**: See `../AGENTS.md` for general interactive workflow rules

**Adapter-Specific Rules**:

DO NOT:
- ❌ Add sections user didn't request
- ❌ Include placeholder text for skipped features  
- ❌ Create example implementations
- ❌ Add "nice to have" features without asking
- ❌ Assume technology choices
- ❌ Create files beyond AGENTS.md and workflows/AGENTS.md

DO:
- ✅ Create minimal, focused content
- ✅ Include only what user specified

---

## Common Challenges

### Challenge: User Wants to Add More Later

**Resolution**: Adapter can be edited manually anytime. Run this workflow again to regenerate, or edit `AGENTS.md` directly.

### Challenge: User Unsure About Technology Choices

**Resolution**: Suggest starting minimal (skip optional sections). Can always add later. Better to start simple than overcommit.

### Challenge: Custom Technology Not Listed

**Resolution**: Select "Other" and let user specify exact details. Don't guess or assume.

---

## Next Activities

After adapter creation:

1. **Configure Agent Tools** (recommended): Run workflow `config-agent-tools.md`
   - Sets up AI agent to automatically read adapter AGENTS.md
   - Agent will natively follow FDD workflows without manual reminders
2. **Review Generated Files**: Check `spec/FDD-Adapter/AGENTS.md`
3. **Read Specifications**:
   - Review domain model specification (if custom technology)
   - Review API contract specification (if custom format)
4. **Initialize Project**: Run workflow `01-init-project.md`
5. **Customize if Needed**: Edit adapter files directly for fine-tuning
