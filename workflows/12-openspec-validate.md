# Validate OpenSpec Structure

**Phase**: 3 - Feature Development  
**Purpose**: Validate OpenSpec directory structure and specifications consistency

**Structure Requirements**: See `../requirements/openspec-change-structure.md` for complete change structure specification

---

## Prerequisites

- OpenSpec initialized for feature
- OpenSpec directory exists: `openspec/` (project root)

## Input Parameters

- **slug**: Feature identifier (lowercase, kebab-case)

**Note**: Before validating, read `../requirements/openspec-change-structure.md` to understand expected change structure

---

## Requirements

### 1: Run OpenSpec Validation (MANDATORY)

**Requirement**: MUST call OpenSpec CLI to validate structure

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: Agent MUST execute this command, not skip it

**Command**:
```bash
# REQUIRED: Run from project root (not from openspec/ directory)
cd {project-root}
openspec validate --all --no-interactive
```

**Agent Instructions**:

⚠️ **MANDATORY**: Agent MUST call `run_command` tool with these parameters:
- `CommandLine`: `"openspec validate --all --no-interactive"`
- `Cwd`: `"{project-root}"`
- `Blocking`: `True`
- `SafeToAutoRun`: `True`

**If exit code != 0**:
1. Read error output
2. Fix issues (see step 2 below)
3. Re-run validation
4. Repeat until exit code = 0

**What This Validates**:
- Directory structure (specs/, changes/ exist)
- All active changes have required files
- Change numbering is sequential
- Status consistency across files
- Spec files are valid markdown
- No empty or malformed files
- Source of truth integrity

**Expected Outcome**: Exit code 0, all checks pass

**Resolution if Failed**: 
1. Parse OpenSpec error output
2. Fix issues (see step 2 for common fixes)
3. Re-run validation
4. BLOCK workflow progression until validation passes

---

### 2: Review Validation Results

**Requirement**: Understand and address any validation issues

**OpenSpec Output Shows**:
- ✅ Passed checks (green)
- ⚠️  Warnings (yellow) 
- ❌ Errors (red)

**Common Issues**:
- Missing files → Create required files
- Empty specs → Fill in specifications
- Status mismatch → Sync status across files
- Numbering gaps → Renumber changes sequentially
- Invalid markdown → Fix spec file format

**Expected Outcome**: All errors resolved, warnings reviewed

---

### 3: List Changes with OpenSpec

**Requirement**: Verify change status and progress

**Commands**:
```bash
# List active changes
openspec list

# List archived changes
openspec list --archived

# Show specific change
openspec show {change-id}
```

**What to Verify**:
- Active changes listed correctly
- Status is accurate for each
- Archived changes properly moved
- No orphaned or lost changes

**Expected Outcome**: Complete and accurate change inventory

---

### 4: Verify Specs Integrity

**Requirement**: Ensure source of truth specs are valid

**What OpenSpec Checks**:
- All specs in `specs/` directory
- Specs are valid markdown
- Source attribution present
- No duplicate or conflicting specs

**Manual Review** (if needed):
- Check specs make sense
- Verify technical accuracy
- Confirm completeness

**Expected Outcome**: Source of truth is reliable

---

### 5: Validate Specs Against Feature Design

**Requirement**: Auto-discover Feature DESIGN.md from spec names and validate against it

**Step 1: Discover Feature Design Files**

For each spec in OpenSpec, extract feature slug and locate DESIGN.md:

**Process**:
1. List all specs using `openspec list --specs`
2. For each spec starting with "fdd-":
   - Extract feature slug from format: `fdd-{project-name}-feature-{feature-slug}`
   - Example: `fdd-fdd-cli-feature-init` → feature-slug = `init`
3. Locate Feature DESIGN.md at `architecture/features/feature-{slug}/DESIGN.md`
4. Verify file exists

**Expected Results**:
- ✓ Found: Feature DESIGN.md for each spec
- ❌ Missing: Report missing DESIGN.md files

**Step 2: Validate Spec Requirements Against Section F**

For each discovered Feature DESIGN.md:

**Load Requirements**: Read Feature DESIGN.md Section F (Requirements)

**Check Merged Spec**: `openspec/specs/$spec/spec.md` (source of truth)

**Check Delta Specs**: Active changes in `openspec/changes/*/specs/$spec/spec.md`

**What to Verify for Merged Specs** (`openspec/specs/$spec/spec.md`):
- ✅ All requirements from Section F are present
- ✅ Requirement IDs match between DESIGN.md and spec.md
- ✅ No requirements that aren't in Section F
- ✅ Requirement descriptions align with Section F

**What to Verify for Delta Specs** (`openspec/changes/*/specs/$spec/spec.md`):
- ✅ ADDED requirements align with new Section F requirements
- ✅ MODIFIED requirements reference existing Section F requirements
- ✅ REMOVED requirements exist in Section F (with deprecation reason)
- ✅ RENAMED requirements maintain ID traceability
- ✅ Delta spec changes match what's described in change `proposal.md`

**Delta Spec Format Check**:
```
## ADDED Requirements
{New requirements from Section F}

## MODIFIED Requirements  
{Changed requirements - full text with updates}

## REMOVED Requirements
{Deprecated requirements with reason}

## RENAMED Requirements
{Name changes only - ID must match}
```

**Step 3: Validate Changes Against Section G**

For each Feature DESIGN.md:

**Load Implementation Plan**: Read Feature DESIGN.md Section G (Implementation Plan)

**What to Verify**:
- ✅ All changes from Section G exist in `openspec/changes/` or `openspec/changes/archive/`
- ✅ Change numbering matches Section G plan
- ✅ Change scope matches Section G descriptions
- ✅ No extra changes that aren't in Section G
- ✅ Each change `proposal.md` references Section F requirements
- ✅ Change tasks align with Section E (Technical Details)

**Expected Outcome**: Complete traceability for all FDD specs

**Validation Criteria**:
- ✅ All specs with `fdd-` prefix have corresponding Feature DESIGN.md
- ✅ All Section F requirements present in spec.md
- ✅ All Section G changes exist in OpenSpec
- ✅ All active/archived changes listed in Section G
- ✅ Each change proposal references DESIGN.md sections
- ❌ Specs without Feature DESIGN.md
- ❌ Requirements mismatch between Section F and spec.md
- ❌ Orphaned changes not in Section G

**Resolution if Failed**:
- Missing DESIGN.md → Create Feature Design (workflow 05, 06)
- Requirements mismatch → Update Section F or spec.md
- Changes mismatch → Update Section G or remove orphaned changes

---

### 6: Output Validation Results

## Common Challenges

### Issue: Missing Required Files

**Resolution**: Create missing files following templates in `09-openspec-change-next.md`

### Issue: Status Mismatch

**Resolution**: Synchronize status across proposal.md and tasks.md

### Issue: Empty Spec Files

**Resolution**: Fill in specs or remove empty files

---

## When to Run

**Regular Validation**:
- Before completing a change
- Before completing a feature
- During code review

**Troubleshooting**:
- When OpenSpec structure seems corrupted
- After manual changes to openspec/
- When merging branches

---

## Next Activities

After validation:

1. **Fix Issues**: Address any errors or warnings

2. **Continue Work**: If validation passes
   - Continue implementation
   - Complete changes

3. **Report**: Share validation report with team if needed
