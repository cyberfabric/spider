# PR Status Workflow

**Type**: Analysis
**Role**: Reviewer
**Output**: `.prs/{ID}/status-report.md`

---

## Routing

| User Intent | Route | Example |
|-------------|-------|---------|
| Check PR status | **pr-status.md** | "PR status 123", `/cypilot-pr-status 123` |
| Check all PR statuses | **pr-status.md** | "status of all PRs", `/cypilot-pr-status ALL` |
| Review a PR | **pr-review.md** | "review PR 123", `/cypilot-pr-review 123` |

---

## Overview

Accepts one argument: a PR number (e.g. `123`) or `ALL`.
Also triggered by natural-language prompts like `cypilot PR status 123`.

**IMPORTANT**: Every status request MUST re-fetch and re-analyze from scratch.
NEVER reuse data or analysis from a previous run in this conversation.
Previous results are stale the moment a new status request arrives.

---

## Paths

- **Script**: `python3 .cypilot/skills/scripts/pr.py`
- **Config**: `{cypilot_adapter_path}/pr-review.json`
- **Templates**: `.cypilot/templates/pr/`
- **PR data**: `.prs/{ID}/`
- **Exclude list**: `.prs/config.yaml` → `exclude_prs`

## Prerequisites

- [ ] `gh` CLI installed and authenticated (`gh auth status`)
- [ ] Repository has GitHub remote configured

---

## Steps

0. **List open PRs (when needed)**
   // turbo
   Run: `python3 .cypilot/skills/scripts/pr.py list`
   ALWAYS run this step WHEN target is `ALL` or no PR number was specified.
   Present the list to the user so they can select a PR or confirm ALL.
   This respects the `.prs/config.yaml` exclude list.
   **NEVER use `gh pr list` directly — ALWAYS use `pr.py list`.**

1. **Generate status reports (MANDATORY — always re-fetch)**
   // turbo
   Run: `python3 .cypilot/skills/scripts/pr.py status <ARG>`
   The `status` command auto-fetches the **latest** PR data from GitHub
   before generating each report — no stale data is possible.
   This creates `.prs/{ID}/status-report.md` for each PR.
   **ALWAYS run this step, even if the same PR was processed earlier in this conversation.**
   Do NOT skip this step. Do NOT reuse previously generated reports.

2. **Assess severity** (LLM task)
   For each generated status report, read `.prs/{ID}/status-report.md`.
   For every unreplied comment with `Severity: TBD`:
   - Read the comment body and its context.
   - Assign a severity: `CRITICAL`, `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, or `LOW`.
   - Edit the `Severity: TBD` line in the status report file to the chosen value.

3. **Audit resolved comments** (LLM task)
   The status report contains a "Resolved Comments (Audit Required)" section.
   Each entry defaults to `- **Status**: ✅ RESOLVED — AI VERIFIED`.
   For each resolved comment:
   - Read the original concern.
   - Open the **current version** of the file at the referenced path/line.
   - Verify the concern was actually addressed in the code.
   - If **verified**: leave the status line as-is.
   - If **suspicious** (not actually fixed): change the status to
     `- **Status**: ⚠️ RESOLVED — SUSPICIOUS`
     and append a warning: `> ⚠️ **SUSPICIOUS**: <reason>`.
     Then move the entire entry to the "Suspicious Resolutions" section.
   Update the suspicious counts in the header table accordingly.

4. **Reorder by severity**
   // turbo
   For each PR, run: `python3 .cypilot/skills/scripts/pr.py reorder {ID}`
   This re-sorts the unreplied comment sections by severity (CRITICAL first).

5. **Present results**
   Read the final `.prs/{ID}/status-report.md` and present a summary to the
   user highlighting:
   - Total unreplied comments and their severity distribution
   - Any CRITICAL or HIGH items that need immediate attention
   - CI/merge conflict status
   - Any suspicious resolved comments flagged during the audit

## Validation Criteria

- [ ] `gh` CLI authenticated and functional
- [ ] PR data fetched successfully (meta.json exists)
- [ ] Status report generated (status-report.md exists)
- [ ] All `Severity: TBD` entries assessed
- [ ] Resolved comments audited against current code
- [ ] Suspicious resolutions moved to correct section
- [ ] Comments reordered by severity
- [ ] Results presented to user with severity distribution
