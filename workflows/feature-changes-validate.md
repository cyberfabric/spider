## Requirements

**ALWAYS open and follow**: `../requirements/feature-changes-structure.md`

Extract:
- Required structure
- Validation criteria (100 points breakdown)
- Pass threshold (≥90/100)

---

## Prerequisites

**MUST validate**:
- [ ] CHANGES.md exists - validate: Check file at feature directory
- [ ] Feature DESIGN.md validated - validate: Score 100/100

---

## Steps

### 1. Read Feature Design

Open feature DESIGN.md

Extract all requirement IDs (Section F)

### 2. Execute Validation

Follow validation criteria from `feature-changes-structure.md`:
- Structure (25 pts)
- Coverage (35 pts): All requirements from DESIGN.md covered
- Task Quality (25 pts): Tasks executable, granular, validated
- Effort Estimation (15 pts): Reasonable estimates

Calculate total score

### 3. Output Results to Chat

**Format**:
```markdown
## Validation: CHANGES.md ({feature-slug})

**Score**: {X}/100  
**Status**: PASS | FAIL  
**Threshold**: ≥90/100

---

### Findings

**Structure** ({X}/25):
✅ | ❌ {item}

**Coverage** ({X}/35):
✅ | ❌ {item}
**Requirements covered**: {X}/{total} ({percentage}%)

**Task Quality** ({X}/25):
✅ | ❌ {item}

**Effort Estimation** ({X}/15):
✅ | ❌ {item}

---

### Recommendations

**High Priority**:
1. {Fix}

---

### Next Steps

{If PASS}: ✅ Proceed to `feature-change-implement`

{If FAIL}: ❌ Fix issues, re-validate
```
